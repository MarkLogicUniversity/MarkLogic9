10) Jonny Evans and the "piece of meat' partyManchester United's 2007 Christmas bash was the party to end allÂ 
parties, largely because Sir Alex Ferguson has not allowed players toÂ 
organise one since. The headlines focused on young Jonny Evans, who wasÂ 
falsely accused of rape, but the incidentals were Bacchanailal: AnÂ 
eight-hour booze-up followed by a party at Manchester's swanky GreatÂ 
John Street hotel, to which 100 hand-picked girls had been invited."It was horrible," said one of what transpired. "A player had beenÂ 
pestering me and my friends for ages trying to get us up to a bedroom. I
kept telling him 'no' but he just wouldn't take it.
"He wasÂ 
really drunk as were the rest of them. Then he just grabbed me andÂ 
started to drag me away from the main area towards the toilets.
"I was in tears. The players were treating girls like pieces of meat."
The
night was also memorable for Wayne Rooney suggesting to one partygoerÂ 
that she and her friend should join him in the toilets for a threesome.Â 
Alas, his roving eye had fallen on Daily Mirror undercover reporterÂ 
Sarah Tetteh.


9) Kleberson and the teenage brideWhen midfielder Kleberson arrived at Old Trafford from AtleticoÂ 
Paranaense in 2003, two things became apparent: he wasn't as good asÂ 
fellow new signing Cristiano Ronaldo and his wife was even younger thanÂ 
the preening Portuguese, then just 18.
It emerged that theÂ 
Brazilian had started dating his missus, the former Daiane Williams EÂ Silva, when he was 21 and she was just 14, turning down a move to LeedsÂ in 2002 because, at 15, she was not old enough to leave the countryÂ without her parents.
The couple married on Daiane's 16th birthday,
which happened to be Valentine's Day, and a little over 10 months later she gave birth to their first child after the  of jumping up toÂ 
celebrate her husband's goal against Blackburn sent her into labour.


8) The King of PornographyNo player has made a more impressive entrance to Manchester United than Dwight Yorke.
Having arrived from Aston Villa for Â£12.6million in August 1998, he managed to make both the back and front pages of a Sunday tabloid a month laterÂ  when it printed stills from a video found in the player's rubbish, which showed he and former Villa colleague Mark Bosnich involved in an orgyÂ  with four women and a transvestite, the keeper being whipped by oneÂ leather-clad blonde while Yorke had sex with her friend. The footballers were later seen donning women's clothing.
It ushered in a goldenÂ age of Yorke shagging stories, of which his former landlady and friendÂ  Sheila Dudley memorably said: "If some girl comes to his house with herÂ knickers in her handbag, it's up to him, isn't it?"
Best amongÂ them was the conquest Yorke had convinced that he was a local postmanÂ named Brian. She said of their trip to a nightclub: "People were comingÂ past and saying 'hello' to him and he said it was because he deliveredÂ 
their letters. I believed him. He seemed a lovely bloke." Later,Â 
he would invite then-girlfriend Katie 'Jordan' Price to Old Trafford,Â 
where Victoria Beckham would greet her in the WAGs' box with a cheeryÂ 
chorus of Who Let The Dogs Out?
In 2001, the pair would approachÂ 
an undercover female Daily Mirror reporter in Monte Carlo, with YorkeÂ asking, "Do you like black men? Do you fancy a threesome?" and PriceÂ pleading: "Come on. Please don't leave me on my own."
Hailed byÂ the Old Trafford crowd with the song, "Dwight Yorke, wherever you mayÂ be, You are the king of pornography", the striker harumphed that theÂ chant "set a bad example to kids", shortly before Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to Blackburn.

7) Fergie and the untouched kneeMarried to the former Cathy Holding for 45 years after firstÂ encountering her in a meeting to arrange a strike at the typewriterÂ  factory where they both worked, Sir Alex Ferguson has one of theÂ strongest marriages in football.
Which meant the press wereÂ immediately sceptical when, in October 2002, 21-year-old softwareÂ technician Nadia Abrahams told South African police that Fergie hadÂ touched her knee and invited her back to his hotel after she offered him a lift when his car was involved in a 2am traffic accident near CapeÂ Town's Waterfront district.
After all, Fergie's only previousÂ brush with anything approaching a sex scandal had come when he wasÂ quoted as describing a former player's penis as "not just big, it'sÂ magnificent", mystifyingly annoying the recipient of the praise, Dion Dublin.

Sir Alex strongly denied any wrongdoing in South AfricaÂ 
and though Abrahams and boyfriend Brian Ebden managed to sell theirÂ story for Â£75,000, the case was dropped shortly after reports emergedÂ claiming Abrahams had "flaunted herself at Sir Alex, dancing round andÂ around him in circles" after Spotting him in the upmarket Mannenburg'sÂ jazz club while the United manager "was behaving like a total gentlemanÂ all night".


6) Ronaldo, Anderson and "no-holds-barred" spankingBefore September 2007, the public thought Cristiano Ronaldo'sÂ 
idea of fun was, in his memorable phrase, "putting a television high in a tree outside and kicking footballs at it".
Then came allegationsÂ that the Portuguese winger had organised an orgy at his Cheshire home,Â inviting two team-mates and five hookers.
Busy BrazilianÂ prostitute Juliana Baltrusch claimed to have performed a sex  onÂ Nani, dirty-danced with Ronaldo and later enjoyed a no-holds-barredÂ spanking session with Rolph-from-the-Muppets lookalike Anderson. A year earlier, the Brazilian midfielder had been the subject of aÂ  tabloid kiss-and-tell in which 20-year-old model Leah Houghton claimedÂ Anderson had chatted her up with the words "f*** f*** f***", after whichshe had sex with him on a toilet.

5) Wayne Rooney, the Auld Slapper and the younger slappersNo wonder he lost his hair so quickly.
Having been aÂ 
customer at Liverpool massage parlour Divas in his Everton days -Â 
sending one girl a note of thanks reading: "I shagged you on DecemberÂ 
26, loads of love, Wayne" and famously enjoying the services ofÂ 
52-year-old PVC-clad mum of seven Tricia 'Auld Slapper' Tierney - theÂ 
spud-faced nipper was thought to have cleaned up his  afterÂ 
then-fiancee Coleen McLoughlin angrily threw her engagement ring into aÂ 
squirrel sanctuary.
After his move to United, Rooney's penchantÂ 
for grappling grandmas was immortalised in the Everton chant: "AuldÂ 
Slapper is a prossie, She plays with dirty toys, And when she shagsÂ 
Wayne Rooney, She thinks of Davie Moyes".
Alas, September lastÂ 
year brought revelations that Rooney had been paying ManchesterÂ 
prostitute Jennifer Thompson Â£1,200 a time for sex, once allowingÂ 
Thompson's like-minded chum Helen Wood to join them for a threesome and a
lesbian show.
Coleen forgave, as only she can, and the mostÂ 
shocking element of the whole farrago was thought by many to be the Â£200
Wayne paid a hotel employee to bring him a packet of cigarettes whileÂ 
sampling Juicy Jeni's dubious charms.
4) George Best, Miss World and the mink coatA swordsman of Beattyesque proportions in early 1970s Manchester,
Bestie wisely opened two private clubs - Slack Alice and Oscar's -Â 
where his roistering would go unreported.
Memorable incidents that
evaded the press included celebrity lawyer George Carman, who hadÂ 
helped clear his friend of slapping waitress Stevie Sloniecka andÂ 
breaking her nose, marching up to him in Oscar's and declaring: "GeorgeÂ 
Best, you blackguard. You've been f***ing my wife."
When Best was not in his Mancunian bubble, however, all bets were .
In
February 1974, he was photographed leaving London society club TrampÂ 
with reigning Miss World Marjorie Wallace, then engaged to Formula OneÂ 
racing driver Peter Revson.
The scandal deepened when BestÂ 
returned to Manchester without her after a row, only to be arrested inÂ 
Slack's at 3am and brought back to London's Wood Lane police station,Â 
where he was charged with burglary of her flat and the theft of a Â£2,000
mink coat, jewellery and spirits.
Wallace was stripped of her title and Best advised that he could go to prison.
But on March 22, five days before Best was due in court, Revson was killed in practice for the South African Grand Prix.
Wallace flew back to the States and the case collapsed.
3) Ryan Giggs becomes  Woods"I canâ€™t believe it, heâ€™s such a family man," said Giggs' agentÂ 
Harry Swales when the jug-eared Quorn enthusiast was finally revealed as
having taken out an injunction to quash stories of a fling with topless
Big Brother mopsy Imogen Thomas.
The phrase could hardly haveÂ 
been more unfortunate given further claims of an eight-year affair withÂ 
brother Rhodri's wife, Natasha.
Now, there's talk of a third woman
and the emergence of fascinating details from the past, including hisÂ 
dalliance with PR girl Caroline Stanbury during his courting of StaceyÂ 
and the rumoured existence of a city centre pad, known as Giggsy'sÂ 
Corner, where conquests could be taken.
2) Martin Edwards blows the toilet doors offManchester United chairman Martin Edwards had long been regarded as a lucky man.
Having
failed to sell  a controlling stake in the Red Devils toÂ 
ball-juggling UFO abductee Michael Knighton for Â£20m in 1989, theÂ 
butcher's son then sat back and reaped the Premier League riches, evenÂ 
brushing  dalliances with prostitutes in Brazil and Switzerland, whoÂ 
gave him stinging reviews including "he was old and like a grandad" andÂ 
"it took four hours to make love and it wasn't very good".
However,
that luck ran out in scandalous fashion late in 2002 when theÂ 
dad-of-two received a police caution after allegedly being caughtÂ 
peering under a cubicle door in the ladies' loos at Cheshire's swankyÂ 
Mottram  hotel.
More allegations followed and former UnitedÂ 
security chief Ned Kelly later claimed to have been briefed to followÂ 
Edwards at the club's post-1996 FA Cup final party as "his visits to the
ladies are becoming more frequent".
Wrote Kelly: "It had been aÂ 
constant source of amusement to the players and ground staff, but it was
undeniably embarrassing. He just seemed to have a compulsion to invadeÂ 
the space of women in their most private moments."
Edwards leftÂ 
the United board shortly afterwards and by 2003 had sold  his stakeÂ 
in United for Â£80m, although he remains an honorary life president ofÂ 
the club and was part of their sparsely-attended and rain-sodden 19thÂ 
title parade around Manchester.
1) Tommy Docherty and the physio's wifeIt's a 'What if...' double whammy which perplexes United fans andjournalists even today: Would Manchester United have broken Liverpool'slate 1970s and 1980s stranglehold on the title had Tommy Docherty notÂ been sacked in July 1977?And how many acres of newsprint would beexpended on the story today had a contemporary Old Trafford boss leftÂ his wife and four children for the physio's missus on the eve of the FAÂ Cup final?Despite offering to resign at the club's victoriousÂ banquet after beating Liverpool at Wembley, The Doc initially survivedÂ the furore and was holidaying in the Lake District, contemplating plansÂ to sign Peter Shilton and the mercurial Tony Currie, when the AxeÂ finally fell.Rumours claimed Docherty had been a victim of WAGÂ power in the shape of letters to chairman Louis Edwards from players'Â wives demanding his dismissal - hardly surprising as the manager hadÂ made his share of dressing room and backroom enemies during fiveÂ turbulent years in which he eased out Bobby Charlton, brutally dumpedÂ George Best and Denis Law and fell out with the likes of Alex StepneyÂ and Gerry Daly.In came safe pair of hands Dave Sexton andÂ Docherty's thrillingly cavalier side, starring midfield schemer LouÂ Macari, wingers Gordon Hill and Steve Coppell and barrel-chested strikerStuart 'Pancho' Pearson, was about to be broken up.The DocÂ himself started ultimately unsuccessful legal proceedings againstÂ Edwards for defamation and wrongful dismissal, announcing his decisionÂ while sporting a black eye given to him by cuckolded magic-sponge manÂ Laurie Brown, to whose ex-wife Mary Docherty has now been married forÂ nearly 30 years.United fans mourned their loss with this creativereworking of Knees Up Mother Brown: "Who's up Mary Brown? Who's up MaryBrown? Tommy, Tommy Docherty."</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yxkgu</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t5xu</id></website><link>http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/03/22/sport/fotball/premier_league/wayne_rooney/20802329/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T16:07:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T21:26:20+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miesf2</id><link>http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/03/22/sport/fotball/premier_league/wayne_rooney/20802329/#comment-473974020</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lyk1f</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
