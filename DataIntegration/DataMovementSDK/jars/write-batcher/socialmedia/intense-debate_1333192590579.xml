They tell these guys what to do, when to do it and who to do it for. I love this "He's the most electable." nonsense. Same argument that was made for Ford, Dole, McCain and every other loser that was nominated.  Romney has the largest gap in his favorable-unfavorable ratings of anyone in this, including the President. Flame on! Republicans. We will, at least, crash and Burn together. Comforting, isn't it?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/675mqa</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4847</id></website><link>http://www.therightscoop.com/its-official-paul-ryan-endorses-mitt-romney-for-president/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:23:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:34:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwhd4b</id><link>http://www.therightscoop.com/its-official-paul-ryan-endorses-mitt-romney-for-president/#comment-480987742</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6rtov</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
