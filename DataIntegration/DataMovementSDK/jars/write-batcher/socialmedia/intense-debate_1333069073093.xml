I think I'll give him a pass on it.Â  If the lady did not want to hear what he had to say, a simple clearing of the throat or "hello" when his companion said "Hi Megan" would have saved her and Harry tons of embarrassment and insult.Â  Harry would have Blushed 10 different shades of red and run  to his office.Â  People are allowed to have thoughts and even share them with another person they trust.Â  So long as they do not Act on them or use them to intimidate another person, I don't think it falls into a "rape mentality."Â  She did a burlesque to sexually titillate.Â  That's why she told Peggy everyone would have sex after her party.Â  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rsgv1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7g4r</id></website><link>http://www.tomandlorenzo.com/2012/03/mad-men-a-little-kiss.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T13:14:00+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-27T20:20:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/ms7qy6</id><link>http://www.tomandlorenzo.com/2012/03/mad-men-a-little-kiss.html#comment-477735742</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rmcjd</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
