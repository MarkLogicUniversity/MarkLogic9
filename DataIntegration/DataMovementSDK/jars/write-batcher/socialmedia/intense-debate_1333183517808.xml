I have been practicing Emergency Medicine for well over a decade and have seen many assaults. Some nasal fractures are obvious others are not. Some nasal fractures are not readily apparent on x-ray. Bleeding is not  associated with fracture. Closed head injuries are not Always obvious. That is why we have CT scans. A hematoma on the back of the head would be the likely outward injury and would not be seen on a grainy video. A concussion definitely does not show up on video.Â  Leave the diagnosing to the doctors. The med record will reflect if he had any injuries. If so, he justified. If not, he's guilty. Has nothing to do with race.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z3b9t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:25:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:41:26+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwl8xs</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-480933428</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7c7w</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
