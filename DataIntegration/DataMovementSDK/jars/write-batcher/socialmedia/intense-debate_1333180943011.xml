         This guys review is pretty Spot on and as a gamer who is pretty hard to please,this game is the one that gets you more emotionally attached to characters than any other I've played.All three ME games are immersive and compelling as well as action packed.The voice Acting is the best hands down,with actors like Martin Sheen,Tricia Helfer and Seth Green lending their awesome VO talent.A perfect game series IMHO.In closing I would say the only dumb ass loser around here is you,or anyone who agrees with your comments.Because you are obviously talking out your ass.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z0rn6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mxvz</id></website><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/mass-effect-3--review-7585863.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T08:55:24+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:27:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwrj4e</id><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/mass-effect-3--review-7585863.html#comment-480919038</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z75sm</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
