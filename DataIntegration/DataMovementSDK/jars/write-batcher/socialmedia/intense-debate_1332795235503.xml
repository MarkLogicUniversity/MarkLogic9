Just this weekend I had that -kilter moment. I posted a comment on my G+ about being on Spring Break, indicating that I was doing a
 :happy dance: and someone who had me circled (now Banned) made a 
completely inappropriate, sexually suggestive remark. It was like Cold 
water splashed on my warm moment. I felt the same way as when I had my 
butt pinched in the park when I was 12.



When I mentioned my upset to my BF and wondered aloud whether I should 
report the offender or just block him, he said those horrible words, "I 
don't know why you're getting so upset about this." Which doesn't make 
me question my upset-ness, it just make me question my future ability to
 share those feelings with him. Which makes me far sadder than the 
original incident upset me.
