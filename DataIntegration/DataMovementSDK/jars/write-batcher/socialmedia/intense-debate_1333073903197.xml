All of these groups have some people that change as they age and earn experience.
 The  differences between the people are the light and the dark. The people of light, are builders, they make and pass on. The dark destroy the work of the light.
 Take eating meat, it's natural to our diet, yet the dark wants us to abstain from a natural habit "to help fuzzy little animals". How many remember hearing about the study that was done when they got their first breaks in pushing companies around for their agenda? The "spuds that Fainted" while another potato was Sliced next to it, then there was the carrot that screamed. Their goal is to keep pushing. The goal won't be met until the people of light are extinguished, that is their job.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zrvne</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ogrn</id></website><link>http://godfatherpolitics.com/4439/gay-bullies-target-apparel-company-because-it-wont-print-shirts-for-gay-pride-festival/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T12:51:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:40:39+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3bn46</id><link>http://godfatherpolitics.com/4439/gay-bullies-target-apparel-company-because-it-wont-print-shirts-for-gay-pride-festival/#comment-479743570</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/e46na</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
