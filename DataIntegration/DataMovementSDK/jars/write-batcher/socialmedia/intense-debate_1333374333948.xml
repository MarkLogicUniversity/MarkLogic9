"Apple is looking for people to Test &amp; Keep the New  3! But only the 1st 1000 users that goto ____(website)____ and enter code BETA will Receive it!"

I actually assumed I had been spammed via Google Plus, as the telephone number was extremely similar to the messages I have received from Google Plus' SMS Notification service.

I did not attempt to visit the site. A general rule of thumb, is that if you ever receive a message about an Apple product, mobile phone, or Weight loss; it is generally a serious scam. Don't visit the site.

ALSO, if you actually Google the term "Apple is looking for people to Test &amp; Keep the New IPad 3! But only the 1st 1000 users," you will receive MANY results... from COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PHONE NUMBERS. All 201 area code. New Jersey Scum--no surprise here.
