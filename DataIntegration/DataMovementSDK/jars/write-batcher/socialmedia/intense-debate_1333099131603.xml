Remember how each side told a completely disparate version of the incident in court? This is exactly that with the exception that one life is ended and another ruined. Everyone demanding "justice" for Trayvon Acts like he was skipping merrily down the side walk with a bag of Tootsie Rolls just minding his own business and was shot for no reason other than that he was Black.
