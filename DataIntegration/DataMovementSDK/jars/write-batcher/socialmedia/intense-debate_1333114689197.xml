Maybe it's just my huge screenwriter-crush on Richard LaGravenese, but man, I did not want a couple to be together more than I wanted Ethan and Lena to be together.Â 

I'm so happy that the draft I read is the production draft, so the movie's likely to be very similar, and so far the casting's been pretty Spot on (except for maybe Emmy Rossum as Ridley -- my personal choice would have been Shailene Woodley).Â 

The only red flag so far is the February release, which is usually the Hollywood dumping ground. But then again, Taken was released in February, and everybody seemed to love that.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ztaa7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/cj6q</id></website><link>http://scriptshadow.blogspot.com/2012/03/movie-review-hunger-games.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:03:39+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T01:23:52+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3i7w4</id><link>http://scriptshadow.blogspot.com/2012/03/movie-review-hunger-games.html#comment-480110922</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g7sis</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
