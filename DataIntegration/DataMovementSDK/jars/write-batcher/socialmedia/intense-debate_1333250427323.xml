1. I never had any credibility to lose.

2. I've said for days the government was playing with fire and it could easily blow up in their face. And have been proved correct.

I'm sorry if it upsets you, but I'm genuinely angry that the evidence is growing that the government has deliberately and willfully created a national emergency for their own crazy agenda.Â 

Such people are not fit for high office. Gordon Brown wasn't fit for office when he came up with all his crazy Wheezes which Always backfired, and now it seems David Cameron isn't fit for office either.

So, first thing to do is obviously to end the crisis and get the country back to normal. And then we must, urgently, find out what the hell has gone on. And if it transpires that this crisis was caused deliberately by the government, sackings must follow. If that means we start with Cameron then so be it. Cause any leader/politician that willfully endangers the stability of the country for their own ends is not fit to be in power.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67haww</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xps8</id></website><link>http://www7.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2012/03/30/romney-now-a-90-percent-chance/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:18:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:53:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwn1kb</id><link>http://www7.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2012/03/30/romney-now-a-90-percent-chance/#comment-481335538</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ekpuz</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
