Muslims
should unite and refocus


It
is unfortunate to see how Muslims are divided on the Balala issue.Balala was
appointed after an MOU signed between him and ODM.Balala had a right to speak
his mind as Muslims are not supposed to fear any other but Allah.I condemn sacking
of Balala or any other person for speaking their mind. 


Muslims,rethink
when you comment on anything.Why do we Always ignore Quran? Allah stated,
â€œAnd hold fast, all together, by the
rope which God (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves;
and remember with gratitude Godâ€™s favor on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in
love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren;and ye were on the brink of the
pit of Fire,and He saved you from it. Thus doth God make His
Signs clear to you: That ye may be guided.â€&#157;(Quran 3:103)


Allah
adds in the holy Quran,â€&#157;Obey AllahÂ andÂ His Messenger (ØµÙ„Ù‰
Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ ÙˆØ¢Ù„Ù‡ ÙˆØ³Ù„Ù…)Â andÂ do
not quarrel among yourselvesÂ lest you lose heartÂ andÂ your
momentum disappear.Â AndÂ be steadfast. Allah is with the steadfast.â€&#157; (8:46)


In
addition the Prophet of Allah(PBUH) as narrated by Nuâ€™man b. Bashir Â said:Â The similitude of believers in regard to mutual love, affection,
fellow-feeling is that of one body; when any limb of it aches, the whole body
aches, because of sleeplessnessÂ and Fever. (Sahih Muslim,Hadith no 2,Book 032, Number 6258: 


In
another Hadith Narrated
by Abu Huraira: Allahâ€™s Apostle said, â€œBeware of suspicion, for suspicion is
the worst of false tales.Â and do not look for the othersâ€™ faults, and do
not do spying on one another,Â and do not practice Najsh,Â and do not
be jealous of one anotherÂ and do not hate one another,Â and do not
desert (stop talking to) one another.Â And O, Allahâ€™s worshipers! Be brothers!â€&#157; (Sahih Bukhari Hadith no 3 Volume 8, Book 73,
Number 92) 


All the above Islamic
texts call us to love one another,correct one another positively and support
one another.If Balala had gone against Islamic Shariah we would have a reason
to support his sacking.Otherwise let us be careful. Today it is Balala tomorrow
it is another person.I advice that Muslims respect their authority like SUPKEM in future so as to make sure that such disappointment do not recur in future.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67cjps</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/z2gh</id></website><link>http://www.the-star.co.ke/national/national/69101-supkem-lashes-out-at-balala</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:01:31+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:01:46+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwishq</id><link>http://www.the-star.co.ke/national/national/69101-supkem-lashes-out-at-balala#comment-481811815</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7970</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
