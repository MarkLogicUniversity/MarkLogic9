If the Lib Dems want to annoy more people, they will have to look inside birth canals or mortuaries as they seem to have given up on the living.

Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, and the Liberal Democrats
 were all prepared to consider curbing the winter fuel payments, which

one with someone aged over 80...&lt;/i&gt;
