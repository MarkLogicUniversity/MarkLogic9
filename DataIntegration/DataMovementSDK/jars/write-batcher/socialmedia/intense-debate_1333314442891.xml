You want to spam pots? 

You want to constantly skip back to town in the middle of an epic boss fight because you're too weak? 

You want to constantly remake the same cookie cutter builds as everybody else? Now, I know people keep bastardizing this, saying that the current skill system makes for cookie cutter builds. 
Come on, before if you were a Paladin, you were a smiter, an auradin, a hammerdin, or a zealer. People online would ask you, "You a Cold Sorc? A Trapassin?" 

The new skill system does take away the chance of f***ing up your character, definitely, and needing to restart and learn from your mistakes. In Dark Souls this works marvelously. In Elder Scrolls, this pissed me Off.

 For Diablo, I'm not sure yet. I honestly liked restarting characters in Diablo 2. Having just one character of each class does seem weird for a Diablo game. But I'm waiting to pass judgement until I have the full game in my hands.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/674w3z</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7d9s</id></website><link>http://pc.ign.com/articles/122/1222066p1.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:54:31+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T04:47:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwfcuy</id><link>http://pc.ign.com/articles/122/1222066p1.html#comment-481541301</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/m5nqu</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
