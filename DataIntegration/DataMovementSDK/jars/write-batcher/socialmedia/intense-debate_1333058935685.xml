OK... I get that Bay Hill wasn't exactly a major, Players or WGC field... but the FACT of the matter is that with an OWGR field rating of 56, it will likely end up being one of the top-10 "other" fields anywhere in the world this year.Â  45 players in the top-100 and 84 in the top-200 is NOTHING to Sneeze at. 

But what has that top-5 you allude to won that's all that much stronger than Bay Hill this year... #1 Luke's win at the TransitionsÂ  was rated only 2 points higher than Bay Hill.Â  But #2 Rory's win at the Honda was rated 6 points less than Bay Hill at 50 and #5 Stricker's win at the TOC was worth 38. #3 and #4 Westwood and Kaymer are ZIP in the win column this year. 

Bottom line... I can certainly understand detracting from short field events like the Chevron or Nedbank, but IMO, while events like the API, Memorial, Quail events may not be the best assembled fields of the year, they're VERY high quality fields never the less. IMO it's folly to sell them short.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h0lho</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/9dd2</id></website><link>http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golftalkcentral/couples-offers-thoughts-on-augusta/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T01:48:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:20:43+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m34kbd</id><link>http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golftalkcentral/couples-offers-thoughts-on-augusta/#comment-479571344</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lwvs1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
