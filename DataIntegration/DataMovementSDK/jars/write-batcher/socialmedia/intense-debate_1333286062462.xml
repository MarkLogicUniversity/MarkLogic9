This is libtard 's real crime - brainwashing kids with evil ideas.Â  I hate to say it but it makes me Glad that I don't have any children of my own because I'd have a heck of a time trying to undo all the liberal trash that would be poured into their brains not only in "innocent" G-rated movies but also in public school. 

There are a few minor exceptions to Christian films not doing well - I think the Naria films have done fairly well for the sci-fi/fantasy genre; at least they seem to do as well as secular-themed fantasy films and were shown pretty much everywhere. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zkoj2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ogrn</id></website><link>http://godfatherpolitics.com/4448/theaters-continue-to-shun-christian-movies-while-catering-to-moral-decadence/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T06:03:48+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T06:24:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw9g6c</id><link>http://godfatherpolitics.com/4448/theaters-continue-to-shun-christian-movies-while-catering-to-moral-decadence/#comment-481590075</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
