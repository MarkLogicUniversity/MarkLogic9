I've been on Mirena for just about 2 years and like some of you I hadn't connected the dots until just recently! I pretty much PMS nonstop sense I've had it, acne has gotten worse, boobs kill, sex drive.....nonexistent, and worse WEIGHT GAIN!!! 40 lbs to be exact! It doesn't help not having energy to even do workouts. Is it just me or do you lady's also get really nauseated from time to time and lastafew days in a row? All I know is that Wednesday this horrible thing is coming out! </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/5ij876</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zfgz</id></website><link>http://qaweb3.lifetimemoms.com/node/4982</link><postedTime>2011-05-02T17:53:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T06:57:05+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw9vmn</id><link>http://qaweb3.lifetimemoms.com/node/4982#comment-481604240</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7b2i</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-05-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
