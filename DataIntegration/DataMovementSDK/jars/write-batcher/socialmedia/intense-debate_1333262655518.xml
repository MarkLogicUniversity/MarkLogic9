Only thing I'll give about 13.The story is great and I love how it feels like it continues and continues.That'sÂ  all and no joke!Every thing else I laugh to death.13-2 &amp; 13-3 HRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/e0vsxa</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dbp5</id></website><link>http://www.gadg.com/2011/09/22/final-fantasy-xiii-2-heading-to-new-york-comin-con-2011/</link><postedTime>2011-09-22T10:05:13+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-24T22:51:14+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkcszj</id><link>http://www.gadg.com/2011/09/22/final-fantasy-xiii-2-heading-to-new-york-comin-con-2011/#comment-475513299</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-09-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
