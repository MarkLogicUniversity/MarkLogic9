Studies confirm that pesticide-producing GMO foods are a danger to living creatures and their ability to reproduce, yet they are forced onto markets worldwide.

Yet privately, they have been caught. From David Rockefeller, to the Queen of England, Ted Turner and China’s ruling class or Monsanto’s own employees and research scientists,
 the very people pushing GMO refuse to eat it. The same is true for vaccines– as in the case where German politicians received a “clean” Flu vaccine while exposing the public to the experimental live virus cocktail jab. These elite know well the genocidal potential of these dangerous policies, as well as the effects of hundreds of other chemicals that have been spiked into our modern lifestyles. From fluoride, to BPA, aspartame and more, reducing fertility and inducing cancer has been underway for decades by design.
