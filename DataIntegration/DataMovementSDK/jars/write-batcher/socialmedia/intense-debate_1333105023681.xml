I can argue back and forth all day long about what is what. How many times do we here of a QB throwing it up high so the TE can go get it against smaller guys etc. Thats not the point. The Ravens D was top shelf. Our D was playing very well. We were in the game. It started to go wrong when we went for it on 4th on a TOSS play against Lewis. I ask you why do you keep Acting as if that didn't matter. Why are you discounting the JC fumble and Dexters. You are the only one that is stringing this on one guy. Sacks are all Cassels fault right? Barry R is a great RT right? Your still trying to say this was Cassel's fault completely when the Cold hard facts that even you have posted says mistakes were made by Haley, JC, Cassel, McCluster, the OL and the OC. So if I was watching through rose-color glasses you covered your eyes with your hands and looked through the crack.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l3jjd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmb</id></website><link>http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/27/3517941/crennel-chiefs-head-into-draft.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T22:26:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:23:40+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3o7bl</id><link>http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/27/3517941/crennel-chiefs-head-into-draft.html#comment-480017172</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/y3skt</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
