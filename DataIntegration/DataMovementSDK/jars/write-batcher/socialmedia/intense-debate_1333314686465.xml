Why in god's name would anyone want to be a press operator.  the noise the Heat the crappy pay.
As for DOD or anything that requires a security clearance just say no... 
Well unless your looking for a job with the FBI... they get ton's of money and just kind of screw Off with it.
Tutoring, ya.. you get paid only when your working.. So it's "piece work" never do piece work. it sucks and it's kind of like working in a sweat shop.
