His funding has  been questionable and he has sued MSN at various times.
However, I WOULD LIKE to hear his views on the breakup of Yugoslavia, where 500
years of  Serbian Nation was granted to Bosnian Islamists.
Prior to the "BOSNIAN SPRING" the Albanian Government was bankrupt and they 
gave up all control. The "young turks" Raided the armouries and distributed the weapons to
their newly formed army, then started shooting any Serbian they could find.
The Serbians reacted. Apparantly too much said NATO.
Albania,then Bosnia.How much do the Turks need to get into Europe.?
Sorry, I meant to ask "Gorgeos George" his views on 350 christian churches Burnt in
Bosnia, after the liberation of Bosnia.
