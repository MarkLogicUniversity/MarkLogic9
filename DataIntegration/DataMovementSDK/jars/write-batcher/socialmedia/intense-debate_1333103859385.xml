"but reviewing the video, rather than isolating single frames, seems to pretty clearly show that what The DC identifies as a possible â€œlacerationâ€&#157; is actually a dark Spot created by variations in the density of Zimmermanâ€™s hair, the curvature of his skull, and the lighting and angle of the shot."

So in other words, Tommy insists thatÂ examiningÂ moving video is MORE relevant that a still. I think that's quite a stretch, as its not as if that would be a different angle- its the same footage, just still. The key here is to consider what a court would say, and with both cases made, I dont think there would beÂ overwhelmingÂ evidence to support a definitive answer on either side.Â 

However..when admitting officers say they cleaned up blood in their report...now THAT is powerful and fullyÂ admissibleÂ evidence from eye witnesses.Â 

BUT..thankfully viewers can decide for themselves, meaning, Tommy is speculating just like everyone else and needsÂ caveatsÂ in the event that his speculations turn out to be wrong.

"That Spot on his head is visible and well-lit in other Spots on the tape, but nothing is visible. Lacerations donâ€™t disapppear Depending on how you light them."

I'll overlook Tommy putting three Ps on his "disappear" here to say that again, I dont think anything can be definitively said from this video and for Tommy to speak in definitive terms to pick apart the DC's analysis is him being guilty of the same thing he is accusing the DC of doing.Â 

Id like to see how many balanced or on pro-Zimmerman's sideÂ Tommy has written throughout this coverage...because if he has been just as unbalanced as he claims the DC has been, then he has a lot of nerve to call them out.Â 

Anyone else on mediaite would be more qualified (or not disqualified) toÂ analyzeÂ right wing bias than Tommy Christopher. Hell, I think we have a better shot of the pravda writing with less bias than Tommy, who has become a bloatedÂ caricature of an actual journalist.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zbp35</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tz1k</id></website><link>http://www.mediaite.com/online/daily-caller-sees-possible-head-injury-in-george-zimmerman-police-video/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:19:16+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:29:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3j7f7</id><link>http://www.mediaite.com/online/daily-caller-sees-possible-head-injury-in-george-zimmerman-police-video/#comment-479970627</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lsdft</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
