Not only are you paying higher taxes to support these losers you are paying more at the store. When low lifes are using EBT cards to buy lobster and fillet your chances you are paying more for those items. Because when the demand goes up so does the price. Feed these losers that pink meet that was so the rage. The truth is that it isnt only the ghettos that will Burn when they shut  the EBTs, it will be the barrios and the trailer parks too. YouTube EBTÂ  and you will be disgusted and the videos of people glorifying them. I think the gove is creating all this social tension just to turn the cars Off to create a smoke screen for there theivery and freedom stealing. Why else would they need to pass the NDAA? IF you dont know what that is, you are going to be in trouble.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zppbg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/30/alabama-nightclub-raises-eyebrows-with-food-stamp-friday-party/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:06:53+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T22:52:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwqfj7</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/30/alabama-nightclub-raises-eyebrows-with-food-stamp-friday-party/#comment-481290027</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z8dgb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
