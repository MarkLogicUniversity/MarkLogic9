"Energy of the past"?  The VOLT (not even being produced at the moment) runs on electricity. Where does electricity come from? Mostly coal which increasingly can't be Burned because of this administrations EPA which stresses an already over-taxed power grid.  You can't really fix stupid. Gas WILL Reach 5.00 per gallon this summer. "All of the above" energy policies doesn't mean a damn thing for people or businesses trying to survive. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rr05x</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zmzu</id></website><link>http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/25/white-house-rebrands-ryan-budget-romney-ryan-plan/</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T14:37:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:28:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk1767</id><link>http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/25/white-house-rebrands-ryan-budget-romney-ryan-plan/#comment-476470887</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/t1np</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
