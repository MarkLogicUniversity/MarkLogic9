Â Maybe a few cigarette Burns in the pant suit...dark circles and puffy Red eye's. Like she'd just been ravished by over 200 Republicans. Â But she was pretty pulled together...lips weren't sticking to her teeth...kept the tourettes under control. Â She must have a grease pit crew that puts her face on for her and teases up that pumpkin head. Â She didn't have her 'one red cent' pinched between her talon's though. Looks like 'one red cent' is all the old moll is going to get out of this 'deal' of Obozo plugs his schnozz and signs it. Â I like that 'one red cent' bit of Pelosi's though. Â It makes her look crazier. Now back to the violent ward Nancy,</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ee7zhf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/president-obama/2011/07/31/republican-scolds-obama-you-can-t-sit-sidelines-and-tweet</link><postedTime>2011-07-31T20:40:11+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-07-31T23:01:14+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/5txhpe</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/president-obama/2011/07/31/republican-scolds-obama-you-can-t-sit-sidelines-and-tweet#comment-271415850</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8nldh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-07-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
