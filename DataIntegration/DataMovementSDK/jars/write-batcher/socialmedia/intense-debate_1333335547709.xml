Do you really suppose that half an hour later--the time of the video--there would still be blood on him?  Do you expect his nose to have been out of shape so you could prove it was broken?  FYI, my nose was broken twice in one week and neither time did it Bleed externally and it didn't look broken except on the X-0ray.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l0qku</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/vooh</id></website><link>http://www.dailytexanonline.com/node/12298</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T00:23:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T16:25:24+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwwd7j</id><link>http://www.dailytexanonline.com/node/12298#comment-481967415</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
