bowed literally to the Saudi king when he first got elected (imagine such unacceptable
TREASON !) Dictator/War Criminal/Mullah Barack Hussein Obama should be
convicted along with his Communist Hillary for TREASON against the American
people and the great American Constitution! America, the land of the free now
being Burned bit by bit by these Islam-Saudi worshipping TRAITORS (and those
Americans who voted for them are as treacherous as these two evil traitors - by
the way, donâ€™t forget 9/11 terrorists are mostly Saudis and one of the main
backers for Ground Zero Jihadist victory mosque is the Saudi royal, Prince
Al-Waleed bin Talal, a nephew of the Saudi king. who now owns the biggest share
of Fox News â€“ see www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129584557)!
Why is there no investigation being opened for all the War Crimes committed by
these two traitors, Obama and Hillary in supporting and arming like terrorists
themselves, the footsoldiers of the Saudi-Qatar kings, the Nazi-like Muslim
Brotherhood-led terrorist rebellion in OIL-RICH Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, thus
replacing their depleting oil and hence, sustaining their global dominant
political power, including by increasing Arabizing OIL-RICH non-Arab
Islamic-ruled world such as Malaysia, Mindanao, Indonesia, Nigeria, Ivory
Coast, North Sudan and so on?! </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67tcrb</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/f7e3</id></website><link>http://www.wnd.com/2012/03/wanted-1-courageous-judge/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:53:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:23:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwscuz</id><link>http://www.wnd.com/2012/03/wanted-1-courageous-judge/#comment-481867898</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lzeik</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
