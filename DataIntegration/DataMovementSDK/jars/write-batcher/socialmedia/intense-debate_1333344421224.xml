What with the bottom teams coming into form (about time I'd say); the run-in  is is going to be a white-knuckle ride for all of us?  Will Utd clinch it or trip over small fry? Will City find another gear (that argument over who takes the free kick today was ridiculous)? Will Arsenal crash and Burn (they will if RVP gets injured)? Will Chelsea  the final of the CL?) and get a fourth place finish ahead of Spurs? Who is gojng down with Wolves (RIP)? There are four teams above on the same points and Villa ain't so far Off. Does anybody care about Liverpool anymore?
