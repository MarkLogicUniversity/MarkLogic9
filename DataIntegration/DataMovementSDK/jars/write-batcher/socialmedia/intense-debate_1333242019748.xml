I also don't understand Spike's amusement at "head boy." The suggestion is obvious, but Spike was educated enough to know about UK school honors...
I also don't get Fred's and Gunn's reaction to Eve at the end of Destiny. I know they're good people, and folks get embarrassed when they lose control, but Eve is capital E Evil. The wishy-wasiness on Angel really kills me sometimes, it's so unrealistic.
I  thought Wes wasn't throw Off by the scrutiny of the council, but by his dad's presence. Either way, you're right that it's good to see all these Wes's do their Wesley thing..
Lineage and Destiny were both fun eps, but their b-stories are on the weaker side. Now that I'm watching Vampire Diaries, I gotta say it's a shame that Angel didn't take up Buffy's mantle more by giving us more genuine horror. There's just not enough "oh crap our coworkers Bleed tears and are full of rage!" on TV.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67dszs</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/lineagedestiny,71249/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:00:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:50:28+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwhxxm</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/lineagedestiny,71249/#comment-481004683</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dp293</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
