The legislative branch of 2010 and the executive branch of 2010 both were too lazy to craft quality legislation that meets constitutional muster and somehow now think SCOTUS should endorse the garbage masquerading as legislation.Â  A simple law structured to increase the number of physicians assistants and nurse practioners, increase the number of medical schools (not IRS attorneys) allow interstate health insurance alliances and allow medical personnel to write Off their educational costs by volunteering in weekend or after hours clinics and hospitals at their current labor rate would turn things around quickly.Â  I suspect the junior justice has already called her mentor and reported the results which were not well received by himself.Â  The belittling of SCOTUS by POTUS at the State of the Union address left a bad taste with anyone who loves America and the Constitution and we rejoice in the lesson on constitutional law that will soon be delivered to the schoolboy.Â  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67m8zf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rrah</id></website><link>http://cnsnews.com/node/529682</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T15:33:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:47:16+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwkqb5</id><link>http://cnsnews.com/node/529682#comment-481841932</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
