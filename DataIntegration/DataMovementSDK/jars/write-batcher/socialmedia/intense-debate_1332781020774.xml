Different stresses, same response. Life as a working drone, one emergency away from financial disaster, a partner who is emotionally tuned out, a kid in college, a chronic illness... When you say "feed the angry beast"--well, please tell me more. I feed it Ben &amp; Jerry's, Girl Scout cookies, and the like, which have contributed to a post-quit smoking weight Gain of just enough to make my current clothes "a bit pinchy". So yes, I have anger, Yes, I'm an emotional eater, but yes, I also want to manage the weight. I should mention that I'm in my sixties, a former runner who has lost the will to exercise on top of everything else. My hunger game is about outrunning myself, I guess.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/z7a7g</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/8z2j</id></website><link>http://www.lifescript.com/Body/Diet/Lose-weight/Food_Fight.aspx</link><postedTime>2009-07-04T21:46:53+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:17:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkfeyr</id><link>http://www.lifescript.com/Body/Diet/Lose-weight/Food_Fight.aspx#comment-476505839</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2009-07-04</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
