They could move their entire community. We can as well, but it will cost us.

The problem with sea level rises is that they are not very predictable. And the warming might not stop when we want it to stop. As Maggie thatcher said, in her 1990 speech:

"It will take, for example, until the second half of the next century, until the old age of my grandson, to repair the damage to the ozone layer above the Antarctic. And some of the gases we are adding to the global Heat trap will endure in the Earth's atmosphere for just as long."

We can't just turn it Off.
