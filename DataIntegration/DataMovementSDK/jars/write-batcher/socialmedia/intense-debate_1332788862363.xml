I'm looking forward to this. I have read a lot of stuff and seen a few documentaries about this guy. His actual life is something you could not make up in Hollywood. He was a certified Cold blooded killer with no remorse even in his later years. He did some really frightening things. I think Michael Shannon will do a great job!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l2mh7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/drg8</id></website><link>http://www.firstshowing.net/2012/michael-shannon-means-business-on-first-poster-for-the-iceman/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:30:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:01:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk93b1</id><link>http://www.firstshowing.net/2012/michael-shannon-means-business-on-first-poster-for-the-iceman/#comment-476587968</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
