Some of the poor people are poor because of no choice of their own and as a good a christian society we should help them.However the reality is not all of  them need help some have made bad choices and others are just lazy. If you have 4 kids by 4 different men and those men do not help support the children they brought in to this world we are supposed to support them and by the way the children Always suffer because they do not have a choice. The welfare well only has so much water in it and the people who fill the well with  the water is decreasing so when the well goes dry these people will starve, die of Thirst or riot because they think people who worked and own more that they do are evil..
I am pretty sure I grew up poorer than 95% of these people who are complaining that they have to be out of their subsidized housing for 8 hours but I made choices to better my life because believe or not if you actually work hard in America you can have a better life.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67tckz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dngw</id></website><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/30/news/bangor/bangor-housing-renovation-upsets-some-tenants/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:54:12+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:01:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwkj8c</id><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/30/news/bangor/bangor-housing-renovation-upsets-some-tenants/#comment-481851579</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7j8y</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
