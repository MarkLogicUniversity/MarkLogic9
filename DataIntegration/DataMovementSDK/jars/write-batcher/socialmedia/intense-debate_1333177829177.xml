It's amazing what people throw away! My husband works in the metal recycling room at our local dump and he's Always bringing things home. Recently he came home with an expensive BBQ that just needed the start/spark switch replaced (a couple dollars from Ace Hardware) and an almost new lawn mower that needed to have the rope pull starter thing adjusted (yes, that's my technical term for it). Oh yeah, he also just brought home an entire bowflex, still in the box. The guy just never got around to putting it together, and his wife got so annoyed stepping over it she finally just brought it in to throw it away. Actually, all of our home gym equipment came from the dump. If you know someone who works at the dump be sure to tell them what's on your wishlist. Their usually pretty good at Spotting the treasure in the trash. ;)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hkatx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6r9q</id></website><link>http://decorating.yourway.net/how-to-furnish-a-house-on-craigslist/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T21:36:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:08:16+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwrl5k</id><link>http://decorating.yourway.net/how-to-furnish-a-house-on-craigslist/#comment-480899119</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dd5ow</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
