I support any dum dum that wants to do this type of  in conjunction with having dim sum for lunch while watching apprentice re-runs. It seems like a natural combo move. Also, I think maybe these guys that do this would have a better chance once they Reach the land of the dead communicating with many of the wiches that were part of the salem witch trials. They probably all wander around the land of the dead waiting for Trump and former contestants of his show to arrive while they interview kids that acccidentally Burned thier parents homes down and died in the mele that ensued. Also, I suspect we have some closet Calgary Flames fans fanning the flames at the heart of the buddist movement. horray, go flames! They're hot this year.</body><verb>delete</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6e2v4i</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4r1e</id></website><link>http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/03/17/dying-as-a-political-act-centuries-old-buddhist-tradition-of-self-immolation-continues-in-china/</link><postedTime>2012-03-17T22:03:57+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-19T16:31:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mj6zej</id><link>http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/03/17/dying-as-a-political-act-centuries-old-buddhist-tradition-of-self-immolation-continues-in-china/#comment-469097811</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z8ck0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>killed</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-17</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
