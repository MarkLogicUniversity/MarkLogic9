so Cheer up miliband. this by-election has shown you that labour values are alive and well and Burning with passion in bradford. go there and harness what has happened or your nasty bliarite brother will snuff out  the labour party along with your ambitions.

remember, galloway was kicked out of labour for telling exactly the truth about bliar and his war. bliar is the traitor to the nation not galloway.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/672s7r</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mxvm</id></website><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/miliband-vows-to-learn-lessons-from-shock-bradford-defeat-7603227.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T10:25:28+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T03:59:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw1zit</id><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/miliband-vows-to-learn-lessons-from-shock-bradford-defeat-7603227.html#comment-481509161</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8yfe8</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
