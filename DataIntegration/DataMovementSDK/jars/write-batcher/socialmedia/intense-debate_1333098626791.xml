But, what happens? The Lakers called his bluff ... and it "hurt his feelings" (ha-ha)! What a CHILD! 
But, you know what ... Odom knows that if he pouts and whines enough, that the Mavs will release him and he'll get back to L.A. (maybe Clippers now and Lakers next season)? Most true "professionals" and REAL ballplayers, would have busted their hump to show their old team what a HUGE mistake they made! Not Odom! He could've taken up at least half of the "Chandler" slack ... but, instead, he sits on the bench and draws that paycheck! Typical, GUTLESS and whiny baby (but, wait ... that's right, he DID come from the "land-of-the-CRY-babies" (Magic, Kobe, Scott, Rambis, etc.), folks who NEVER get "touched" without cryin' to the officials! Go back home, Lamar O'Dashian! We don't need ya!Â  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zatoe</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmw</id></website><link>http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/03/28/3843549/like-others-before-him-lamar-odom.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T04:05:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:52:46+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m39jyc</id><link>http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/03/28/3843549/like-others-before-him-lamar-odom.html#comment-479938935</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5opav</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
