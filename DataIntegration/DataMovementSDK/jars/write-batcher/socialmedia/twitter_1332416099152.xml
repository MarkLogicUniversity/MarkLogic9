I noticed - and noted at the time - that Ed Miliband's class war rebuttal was surprisingly good, and had Cameron looking very red-faced and discomfited.

It really is the PM's weak Spot - his guilt at his own privileged background. That's why Cameron keeps saying "I make no apologies for going to a fine school" Â - he feels a need to apologise for going to a fine school. For being Etonian.

If the fairly mediocre Red Miliband can make hay from a budget, then it is clear that it is going to suffer elsewhere.

I predict a fairly sharp Labour Bounce in the polls. I also predict this will fizzle out within a few months, Barring the Unforeseen, because Labour still have zero credibility on the economy, and Balls and Miliband are still unsellable.
