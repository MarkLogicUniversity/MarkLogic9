A statment from an IDF soldier

"The inability or unwillingness of Israeli security forces to control settler violence and, in this case, protect Israeli citizens from that violence, was particularly evident to me during my service in Hebron. During my active duty, my unit responded to Palestinian youth throwing stones with tear gas, rubber bullets, and on at least one occasion live fireâ€“ while allowing comparable settler behavior to go unpunished. I was involved in many arrests of Palestinian youth, even as young as thirteen, who were handcuffed, blindfolded, and brought back to base as the sun came up to be handed Off to their Shabak interrogators. Settler youth who threw stones, Burned tires, laid spikes in the road to disable our patrols, and attacked Palestinians and their property, never received as much as a scolding while I was there, let alone being subjected to punitive measures."

Indeed. Israel is scared that it will be found to apply pressure based on race.
