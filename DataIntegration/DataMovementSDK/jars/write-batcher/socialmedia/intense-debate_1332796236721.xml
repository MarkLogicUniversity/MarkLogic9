Let me put it this way. You own a company that sells fire insurance. You have lots of people buying it and you have to pay out as well. If the Government demanded that you must sell insurance to cover a person the day AFTER there home Burns down how long do you think you would last. 

The major issue with this is the FEDERAL government has made a law that says you MUST buy health insurance if you want it or not ( they have never had this power before as they have never made such a mandate on the people) second if you CHOOSE not to get the health care insurance your breaking the law there is a rule for paying a "FINE" on your tax form if you do not have insurance. This is UNPRECEDENTED in our nations history!

Never before has the federal government told the American people you have to buy something or your a criminal. 

As far as the stated cheaper run government items electricity, water and transportation your simply wrong. As a person who has owned two business selling he first building the second and selling that as wellÂ  red tape Always costs more. If insurance provided by a tax or forcing people to buy it ( it is based on income so again this is nothing but a welfare program ) then why does EVERY place that offers this type of system already have such a MASSIVE tax rate? Not one country with this type plan has had a drop in costs!!! They have all had drops in new doctors. They have all had drops in quality. They have all had drops in waiting times. None have had a REDUCTION in cost not one. This is the FACTS! They are easily checked. Most just ignore them as they see the new American way to get something for "free" without having to work for it. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rmnnr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dngw</id></website><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/25/news/why-health-care-is-permanently-changed/</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T08:38:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:15:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk1msc</id><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/25/news/why-health-care-is-permanently-changed/#comment-476461299</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ha9bu</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
