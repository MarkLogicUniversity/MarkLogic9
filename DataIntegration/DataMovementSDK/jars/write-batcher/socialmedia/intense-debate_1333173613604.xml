Iam proud to be a nepali and i do believe you are as
proud as me to be a member of your own Tribe,i am not feeling insecure and i
believe none of my people have this insecure feeling. what i wanted to say was
that you guys never comment on incidents where people address you as Korean or
Japanese(that happens most of the time) than why do you feel humilated when
someone address you as Bahadur that gives me a question to think about and the
only answer that i can get is because we are from a marginalized society, but i
do believe that we too are in the road of prosperity(even though we are far
behind Japanese,Koreans and U people).


Every king was once a Crying baby and Every great
building was once a map.


Itâ€™s not important where u r TODAY, BUT where you
will Reach TOMORROW
