So the people who developed education were Christian. The majority of people in previous centuries were highly religious. So if you want to argue intelligence correlates with religion, than why is it that faith and doctrine are the same now that they were in 1400 AD? This was a time where they thought drilling a hole in your head healed disease by releasing evil spirits, and that Bleeding was an effective form of treatment. Scientific rigor developed as faith stopped interfering in discovery -- look at the treatment of Galileo. 

Second, let's look at the science of the bible. If we Depended upon this, we would think bats are birds (Lev 11:2)

Rabbits chew their cud (Lev 14:7)

And the mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds. (Matt 4:31-32)

Do you honestly believe these are true? If you do, perhaps you shouldn't be correlating science and religion anymore. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z62q1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4r1e</id></website><link>http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/03/29/father-raymond-j-de-souza-whither-the-religious-left/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T11:32:36+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:28:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3q2hq</id><link>http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/03/29/father-raymond-j-de-souza-whither-the-religious-left/#comment-479577511</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzcqs</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
