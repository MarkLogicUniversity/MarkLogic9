About a month ago my grandson's nose was broken in three places at school recess by a wayward field hockey stick.Â Â  It Bled all over the place.Â Â  My daughter asked me to take him to Urgent Care and dropped him Off at my place.Â Â  You won't believe this, but all that blood was gone!Â  His nose looked a little crooked and he needed surgery to fix it and I'm happy to report he's as handsome as ever!!!

So don't believe everything you see in a grainy security video.Â  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hkoel</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ry2d</id></website><link>http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=50511</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T22:10:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:42:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m33te0</id><link>http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=50511#comment-480252491</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cmp1c</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
