However, an older player who knows the 162 game marathon and paces himself, who is savvy and is professional-- don't count him out!Â  I saw Freddy Garcia completely handcuff lineups with his batting practice speed pitches last year, whereas Mariners fans used to tear their hair out when Garcia was a flamethrower missing his Spots.Â  It's why you see younger teams play so well out of the gate but fade in the summer.Â  They are all enthusiasm and energy but they don't have the battle-tested quality so many of the Yankees have.Â  Jeter not only finished strong last year he did in 2010 as well.Â  

The old guys know how to finish strong because they save some in the tank and if they have the right character and drive to win a few more years doesn't make much difference.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zfeun</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27740482%26vkey=news_mlb%26c_id=mlb</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:25:23+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:19:26+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwngvq</id><link>http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27740482%26vkey=news_mlb%26c_id=mlb#comment-481310371</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cszxk</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
