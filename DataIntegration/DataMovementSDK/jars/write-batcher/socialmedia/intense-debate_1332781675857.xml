 whole freaking out over Mass Effect 3's ending is why everyone looks at
 gamers like children and socially-inept weirdos. I enjoy my video 
game time but I'm not a Cry baby or child if a game doesn't end the way I

 want it to. Sad world we live in. There's a lot bigger problems going 
on in the world than to flip out over a video game. I would hope that 
some of you might read this and realize how absolutely silly you're all 
being and take what you can get cause some people aren't even fortunate 
enough to "waste" sixty dollars on a game or even enough to feed 
themselves. If you disagree and want to insist that it is a HUGE deal 
then go right ahead America gives us that freedom, but you also have to 
see how spoiled we are as a culture to have everyone Act like this.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6cqa7s</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7d9s</id></website><link>http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/122/1220712p1.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-14T10:38:42+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-14T20:53:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mfcnah</id><link>http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/122/1220712p1.html#comment-465419569</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/za6ks</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-14</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
