Sinus Headaches.Â  There was no such thing as a sinus Headache until Madison Avenue invented it to sell, I think it was .Â  Remember hearing about this in nursing school, back in the dark ages. 

And Advil! Ibuprofen was an excellent analgesic while it was prescription.Â  We gave it for postop pain. Once they made it over the counter (yes, I know, they switched from 600-800 mg down to 200 mg) suddenly people wouldn't take it.Â  Because OTC can't be any good, right?Â  Same thing with Dramamine. Dramamine is a highly effective antinauseant, used to be prescription. You can still buy it OTC, but sending somebody to the drug store to pick up some dramamine to help you keep liquids down during a GI illness- people won't.Â  It's not as dramatic as going to a walk-in clinic or emergency room.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/678213</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/hxgv</id></website><link>http://politicalgates.blogspot.com/2012/03/one-more-reason-to-fight-right-wings.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T11:29:48+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T17:53:08+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw0k6p</id><link>http://politicalgates.blogspot.com/2012/03/one-more-reason-to-fight-right-wings.html#comment-482043701</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hp2</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
