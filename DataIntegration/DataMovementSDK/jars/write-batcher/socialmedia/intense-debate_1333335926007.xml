Thyroids often play a larger role in weight issues than anything else.   Add to it weight Gain from long work hours, kids, financial stress in tough economic times the weight can go on quickly.   It is also sometime pure genetics that the body doesn't process intake the way it should.  

Regardless of the reasons just because someone is overweight based on an unrealistic and unhealthy model lifestyle doesn't mean they should be condemned.   Everyone has something in life they don't handle well.  For some it's physical, others it's emotional or financial.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67xhtd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/31/living/fatshion-beauty-bloggers/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T04:07:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T16:27:34+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwwysv</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/31/living/fatshion-beauty-bloggers/index.html#comment-481969312</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/psqc</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
