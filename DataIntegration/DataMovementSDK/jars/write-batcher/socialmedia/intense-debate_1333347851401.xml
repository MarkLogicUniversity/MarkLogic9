When I looked in the mirror and said that to myself, my response was Nausea. It just goes against everything I am about. I am a rancher, a silent partner in a construction company, and have a full time job at a local power plant. I am 59 years old,Â I am very active in a lot of community organizations. I guess I am a closet democrat. Â I live in the reddest county in the state. Emery County. My vote means nothing here, yet I Always vote and encourage my children to do the same. I thoroughly enjoy your posts, and by the way, your adversary Liberated Jim gets a lot of his "FACTS" from James O'Keefe, who also happens to be the biggest self serving dikweed on this planet. Hammer him onÂ that when you get the chance. Thanks for the entertainment.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z3ycz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6rx1</id></website><link>http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/53793204-82/vote-hatch-chair-delegates.html.csp</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:11:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T00:11:48+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m01q4i</id><link>http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/53793204-82/vote-hatch-chair-delegates.html.csp#comment-483194838</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/d4cew</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
