I was 15 years-old when HurricaneÂ Katrina wiped out New Orleans, andÂ myself and thousands of othersÂ survived it. For someone like you to say something like that about a city and its residents, shame on you. The city of New Orleans is my home and I'm proud of it. The Saints brought this city back to life and kick started its rebirth. New Orleans and the state of Louisiana is stronger than before. Don't dare ever step foot in the state of Louisiana, because God help you, you would get fed to the gators. You're insane for what you have said, and I understand it's your opinion. But let me tell you something, Dxsmopuim, the Saints will overcome this and once again be a victorious team. This isn't the only team in the league with Bounties, they just got cought because someone snitched. So, truly think about the comment you made, because in my opinion, it's not humane. Burn in hell!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6d0lva</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/49ga</id></website><link>http://www.foxsportsohio.com/03/21/12/NFL-hands-out-suspensions-for-BountyGate/landing.html?blockID=692880&amp;feedID=3800</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T19:13:05+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T14:16:39+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mp0eld</id><link>http://www.foxsportsohio.com/03/21/12/NFL-hands-out-suspensions-for-BountyGate/landing.html?blockID=692880&amp;feedID=3800#comment-473613272</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
