Markets are down for a third day since the Tuesday afternoon reversal
Commodities leading the tape lower-  Oil already at the 50day.
 
The 8:30 numbers did not help
QQQ are approaching its 10day at $67.34  (still  best above all moving averages)
XLF- is below the 10day of $15.78- next big support is 15.40 area ( they are a bit heavier today)
RTH- is on the 10day at $41.76 the 20day is $41.21
$USO – is at the 50day leading us down $39.55
 
$SPY is now approaching the 20day at $139.03  (if you are still short from Tuesday- nice hold I covered early yesterday)  This probably a good Spot to cover.
Under the 20day $138.50 is a pretty big Spot— A Spot to examine the leaders and see if we can buy for a tradable Bounce.
