Â  I opted for non-3D versions of movies because it Always leaves you with a slight Headache..Â 

Â BUT THEN &gt;&gt; Â  i was at an electronic store and saw a 3D camera (and watched me and my friend on a 3D TV)... I was sold!! Â haha!!

so I bought the camera and now annoy everyone showing them my 3D videos!!

Â - though I am still tired of movies in the cinema cashing in on the 3D train.. i guess I am a hypocrite!
anyway,, I made some 3D video and uploaded it to youtube and would be cool if you saw it and let me know if it annoyed you or pleased you ^^
