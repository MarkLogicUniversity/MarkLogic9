Filburn is still good precedent, Congress can do whatever they want.  

I for one was expecting Wickard to be overturned if the law were to be invalidated.  Otherwise, the biggest Federal Government over Reach occurred during the New Deal.  If Scalia, Thomas, and fellow conservatives were actually concerned about Congress over stepping it's bounds, the petitioners would have filed for stare decisis review, and the justices would have to look at cases such as Wickard to truly achieve their stated goals.  

Otherwise, it's just a matter of how political the court is willing to get. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67cc84</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/opinion/dorf-supreme-court-health/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:27:37+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:37:16+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwr0r1</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/opinion/dorf-supreme-court-health/index.html#comment-480929172</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z2zen</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
