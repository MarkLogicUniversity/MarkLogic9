That is what the right's base should ask themselves:Â  If it was true that global warming is a fiction that is bought and paid for by "liberals", what do the "liberals" expect to get out of it?Â  We know what the right will &lt;i&gt;lose&lt;/i&gt; - more wealth than the average American can conceive of - if we start Acting responsibly and reduce the Burning of carbonaceous forms of energy, but &lt;i&gt;what is in it for "liberals"?&lt;/i&gt;Â  Do the "liberals" &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; the sun, the wind, the sea - all forms of alternative energy?

The answer to that question is clear:Â  The "liberals" hope to save their planet and a future for their children - for &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of America's children, to &lt;i&gt;include&lt;/i&gt; the children of the right.Â  

lollll....and then there is the question of how could the "liberals" &lt;i&gt;afford&lt;/i&gt; to buy such science?Â  It is the right that has the money...and the will...to buy science; just ask Big Tobacco, King Coal, Big Oil, corporations like GE, individuals like the Koch brothers, etc.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zt8ir</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yzhq</id></website><link>http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/03/29/143519/conservatives-have-lost-faith.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:05:51+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:09:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3s098</id><link>http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/03/29/143519/conservatives-have-lost-faith.html#comment-480229850</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8uzmf</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
