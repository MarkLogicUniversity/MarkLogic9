This uses a  which is charged at home or whilst parked. If you go on a longer journey, then you go into a filling station and replace the whole Battery, exactly like filling a car. It is now starting to be rolled out in Israel and I understand that Denmark and Portugal signed up for it as well.
Day time parking Spots in Israel and Portugal will use solar energy. Those in Denmark will use wind energy. Overnight parking will use capacity from existing power stations. Very few people in Israel have garages. The recharging Spots will be on-street or in car parks belonging to flats. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z6vdu</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4pgc</id></website><link>http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/03/29/electric-cars-not-seen-better-fuel-cars/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T11:57:06+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T14:46:45+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwy4kx</id><link>http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/03/29/electric-cars-not-seen-better-fuel-cars/#comment-480814545</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z78aa</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
