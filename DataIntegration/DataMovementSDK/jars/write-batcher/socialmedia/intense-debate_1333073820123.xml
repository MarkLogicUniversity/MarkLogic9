to the Orlando Fox affiliate, telling the station that his son had no 
choice but to kill Trayvon or risk being beaten to death.
â€œThings
 were not going to go well. One of them was not going to walk away,â€&#157; he 
said. â€œI hope at one point everyone will go beyond the hate. At some 
point when all this settles, theyâ€™ll say, â€˜George Zimmerman is a pretty 
nice guy.â€&#157;       


  
      
      George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Feb. 26 in a case that has 
triggered protests nationwide. . . .
Robert Zimmerman, a retired Virginia 
magistrate, said the family is in hiding and canâ€™t go to the doctor or 
do anything that requires using their own names. 
He said his son 
had just made dinner for his wife and was heading to Target the night of
 the NBA All Star game when he Spotted Trayvon, who he didnâ€™t recognize 
as a resident. He thought Trayvon looked suspicious, because there had 
been a rash of break-ins, and instead of walking on a main sidewalk, 
Trayvon was walking in a paved path that goes behind two sets of 
townhouses.
George Zimmerman called police, and started â€œwalking 
in the same general direction to see where the individual was going,â€&#157; 
and get an address for police.
At one point, he said, Trayvon 
approached him saying, â€˜Do you have an f-ing problem?â€™ George replied no
 and Reached for his cell phone.
Trayvon â€œpunched him in the nose,
 his nose was broken, and he was knocked to the concrete.â€&#157; Robert 
Zimmerman said. â€œItâ€™s my understanding Trayvon Martin got on top of him 
and just started beating him in the face, in his nose, hitting his head 
on the concrete.â€&#157;
â€œAfter nearly a minute of being beaten,â€&#157; Robert 
Zimmerman said George tried â€“ with Trayvon still on top of him â€“ to move
 away from the concrete onto the grass. In doing so, the gun he kept in a
 holster on his waist was exposed. 
â€œTrayvon Martin said something
 to the effect of â€˜youâ€™re going to die nowâ€™ or youâ€™re gonna die tonightâ€™
 -- something to that effect,â€&#157; he said. â€œHe continued to beat George. At
 some point, George pulled his pistol and did what he did.â€&#157;
