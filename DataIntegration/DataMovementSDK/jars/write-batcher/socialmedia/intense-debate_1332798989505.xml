would provide tax credits to replace diesel-fuel Burning truck engines 
with natural gas-powered engines" 

These tax credits (subsidies) is what has gotten us to this economic mess in the first place.Â  Don't just take away the subsidies from "Big Oil" take it away from everyone.Â  Let the free market decide which energy resource makes it.Â  Without tax subsidies for "Big Oil", "green energy" concepts, and natural gas they will all have equal footing in the market.Â  If natural gas is so cheap, then it will dominate over "Big Oil".Â  I'll never buy an electric car because I don't want to have to sit around for 4 or more hours to let the Batteries recharge when I'm driving down to TX from MO to visit my mother.Â  Its already a 15hr trip sometimes longer because of the kids.Â  I will however look at a natural gas car.Â  Plus the military already uses natural gas in some of their pick-ups and they can still haul a good load.Â  Can a electric truck handle that?Â  Oh yeah wait there isn't even one yet.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ypxqvz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/29/opinion/pickens-natural-gas-energy-security/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-02-29T19:17:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-02T14:50:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m4xr0j</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/29/opinion/pickens-natural-gas-energy-security/index.html#comment-454491639</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8nb5m</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-02-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
