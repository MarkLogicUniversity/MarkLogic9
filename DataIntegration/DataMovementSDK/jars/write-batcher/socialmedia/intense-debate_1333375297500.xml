"Andy Murray suffered a final heartbreak"

Oh dear! Andy's lost again. And he will continue to loose if he plays 'wait- for- opponents' mistakes-tennis' - against the likes of of Novak Djokovic; especially later Â in the Slams. Even in three-setters, like here in Miami,Â Murrays's beatable with his fear of attacking on big points.

Despite Djokovic playing at 75% and snortingÂ like a cart horse withÂ  his Breathing problems ( and Murray's 2 extra days Off) you never thought Murray had a chance of winning - even in aÂ tie-breaker in the 2nd set. No way!


Bring in a shrink for Andy, Ivan.Â The answer's in his Â head not in the gym.Â Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vf4jt</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mxvr</id></website><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/djokovic-beats-murray-to-win-miami-title-7606725.html</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T19:42:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T09:55:02+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0o9qu</id><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/djokovic-beats-murray-to-win-miami-title-7606725.html#comment-483390563</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hjxvw</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
