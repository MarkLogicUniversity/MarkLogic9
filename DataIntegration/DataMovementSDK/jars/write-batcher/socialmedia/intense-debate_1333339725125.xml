I only have one point I'd like to add to. With the right support, I don't feel that breastfeeding is a huge inconvenience. In fact, I very much enjoyed not having to worry about getting up to make a bottle every 2 hours, Heating it to just the right temperature, washing and sterilizing them...breastmilk is  ready and Always the perfect temperature. You don't have to stress that you didn't pack enough bottles for the trip. It does hurt pretty badly for the first couple weeks, but if you stick with it, it becomes painless and pleasant. It's healthier for both mommy and baby. Studies have shown that breastfeeding will actually raise a child's IQ by 10 points! Breastfeeding may not be for everyone, but I just don't want moms to be afraid to even try it. You just have to be patient, and remember that both you and your baby are learning together. It will take time so just stay calm, and you CAN DO IT!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/g8sn9o</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/65jj</id></website><link>http://kateelizabethconner.com/motherhood-101-the-first-year/</link><postedTime>2011-05-18T18:21:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T12:59:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwik77</id><link>http://kateelizabethconner.com/motherhood-101-the-first-year/#comment-481810587</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-05-18</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
