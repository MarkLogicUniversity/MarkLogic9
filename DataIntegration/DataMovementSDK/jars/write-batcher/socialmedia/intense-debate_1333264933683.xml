scot-free.   </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6d28nj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/hwbb</id></website><link>http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2109511,00.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-20T16:40:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-27T13:22:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/msddef</id><link>http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2109511,00.html#comment-477394801</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zyd8q</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-20</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
