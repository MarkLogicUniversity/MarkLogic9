You weren&amp;#039;t Spot on with Jimmy Jones. 
While being manhandled as he was escaping the trouble he fell/jumped/was pushed  the pitch on to the spion kop terracing and broke his ankle. 
Hardly the same as being thrown  a stand is it? Also pictures of Jones the next day show bar his broken ankle a relatively unscathed Jones eating breakfast in hospital. Very reminiscant of that other survivor of a Linfield hate mob, aesop mullan. 
 
The rest of your post is your usual attempt to deflect away from those angelic dcfc fans. 
 
And as Always it has failed. 
 
Is singing i i i i r a or the entire home support chanting dirty orange b@stard at Micheal Gault what constitutes moving on these days? 
 
The great thing too about watching at home was being able to rewind and clarify just exactly what you forward thinkers were chanting. 
My brother provided the rest of the information with live updates from 7.30 reagrding the antics of the lovely Londonderry locals. 
 
Deny, deflect, revise, repeat ad nauseum. 
It&amp;#039;s the dire city way. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:184182:127107411</id><idPostId>127107411</idPostId><idBlogId>184182</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:184182</id><idBlogId>184182</idBlogId><link>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk</link><displayName>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/local/linfield-may-switch-off-setanta-16134678.html?r=RSS</link><displayName>Linfield may switch off Setanta - Local, Football - Belfasttelegraph.co.uk</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:18:06.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:184182:127107411:324910568</id><inReplyTo><link>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/local/linfield-may-switch-off-setanta-16134678.html?r=RSS#IDComment324891451</link></inReplyTo><link>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/local/linfield-may-switch-off-setanta-16134678.html?r=RSS#IDComment324910568</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:18:06.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Linfield may switch off Setanta - Local, Football - Belfasttelegraph.co.uk by MartinPenwald</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://intensedebate.com/people/MartinPenwald</link><idEmailMd5>6a6a2e3e69e682a526b2d24b49c66f96</idEmailMd5><displayName>MartinPenwald</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/people/MartinPenwald"&gt;MartinPenwald&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/local/linfield-may-switch-off-setanta-16134678.html?r=RSS"&gt;Linfield may switch off Setanta - Local, Football - Belfasttelegraph.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
