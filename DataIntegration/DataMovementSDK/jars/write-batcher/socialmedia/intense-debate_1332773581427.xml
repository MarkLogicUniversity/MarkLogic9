It&amp;#039;s now 3.30 so this will hit the dead Spot for this particular comment thread. 
 
His article starts by examining the actual and projected growth in our debts from the present &amp;pound;1trillion to &amp;pound;1.4 trn . By 2016-17 interest alone on our debts will be around &amp;pound;70bn .   That&amp;#039;s money down the drain .   
 
He examines state spending to see how we got there from &amp;pound;450 bn (adjusted for inflation)to &amp;pound;700 bn today  .. First the NHS went up by 140% partly to fund new drugs with the result we lived longer and that put pensions by 78%.  He adds &amp;quot;As a political proposition, cutting the NHS&amp;rsquo;s outlay in order to kill  our elderly is unlikely to win votes, so we need to look elsewhere for - - - savings. 
 
Brown opened the floodgates of welfare spending in 2002 -07 (+40%)  and protected the unjustified bonanza by changing the definitions of poverty  and (he adds) &amp;quot;&amp;ldquo;Fairness&amp;rdquo; is stuck on every Act of income redistribution like a supermarket price label. Those who question the recipients&amp;rsquo; needs are branded &amp;ldquo;callous&amp;rdquo; -0 - -Opponents of responsible spending talk of bringing back the 50p tax rate (which raised just &amp;pound;1 billion) and a new bankers&amp;rsquo; bonus levy (&amp;pound;3-4 billion) as if they alone might solve our debt problems. This is ludicrous. To achieve a balanced budget, we need much less spending. We cannot tax our way to prosperity&amp;quot;
