He has publicly badmouthed every single person that he's ever worked with or known.

Directors, actors, producers, writers, ex-wives, girlfriends, former buddies - it doesn't matter, he's badmouths them.

When he was on his "Torpedo" tour he even badmouthed Oliver Stone (who cast him in "Platoon" &amp; "Wall Street") saying that his movies "suck".

He looks like shit now and in that interview he was twitching as if he had a live wire up his ass.

There was a time in Hollywood that if someone comported themselves like Sheen they would be shunned.

He couldn't get a good network to broadcast his shitcom so he had to settle for F/X which basically shows re-runs and older movies.

With all the bad karma he's brought on himself it would serve him right if this show crashes and Burns.
