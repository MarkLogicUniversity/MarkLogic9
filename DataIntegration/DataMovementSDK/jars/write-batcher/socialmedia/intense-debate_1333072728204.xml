Fuhrman would have you avoid all cooking oils, which would get your omega 6/3 ratio into a much healthier  range. Weight Gain, bad lipid scores, elevated glucose and blood pressure are just our body's way of telling us that our diet and lifestyle need improvements.  It'll be a great day when the medical community leads with sound  nutritional counseling instead of a prescription for statins.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/r9894</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/8z2j</id></website><link>http://www.lifescript.com/channels/healthy_living/Health_Conditions/tips_for_lowering_cholesterol_naturally.asp</link><postedTime>2009-05-28T23:38:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-12-11T20:13:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/el9n5q</id><link>http://www.lifescript.com/channels/healthy_living/Health_Conditions/tips_for_lowering_cholesterol_naturally.asp#comment-384191587</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rh2ye</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2009-05-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
