1-He was set the same requirements as any manager who was likely to takeover, CL, one or two cups [tbh I do not think we will even win the FA]
2-He got the finances to facilitate the objectives laid out by the owners, and went on shopping spree for dross
3-His excuses about our loses have become even more bizzare as each game passes-by, kits, Tiredness, injuries, the ex-players who were quick to nail Hodgie and Rafa, are suddenly quite timid, cannot criticise KD
4-His lack of game flow-awareness is bizzare for a player who was well above most for the Reds, team selection is another Headache,Â 
5-Sending some of our accomplished players to the bench or out on loan is amazingly stupid after buying squad &amp; future players and completely rejecting our youth reserves
6-His brutal defence of his failure sends Shivers down all true Reds, jornos and the owners, they will make a decision to let him go soon, with all our blessings.
As one of us pointed out we really need a replacement, we all experienced the murmuring after the game, with supporters walking Off, after KD insulted some of us supporters for being brain-dead.
Enough is enough, he should go just like any other manager who has failed to attain basic managerial targets, we should be looking for another Â manager, the process has already started if the owners mean business.
LETS STOP KIDDING OURSELVES - NO MAN IS BIGGER THAN LFC - EVEN KENNY.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rprgd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gfg</id></website><link>http://www.liverpool-kop.com/2012/03/arsenal-legend-insists-two-cups-is-not.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T10:36:04+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:14:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkjg25</id><link>http://www.liverpool-kop.com/2012/03/arsenal-legend-insists-two-cups-is-not.html#comment-476597524</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
