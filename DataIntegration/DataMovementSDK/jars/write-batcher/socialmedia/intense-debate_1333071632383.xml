I appreciated Mr. Ferrara's candor. As to any of the commentators drawing the conclusion that he is using non-prescribed narcotics for recreation from his answer "I haven't had a drink for over a year" in reply to the question "How long have you been sober?"  I would give the guy a break. Like him, I have not had a drink and I am on a small dose (,5mil.) of Suboxone and a day for opiate addiction. I also take klonopin from time to time for extreme Anxiety). Does that make me not sober?  on one's personal world view. Right now, I feel hopeful and much better  and have a chance to deal with the underlying issues that have  brought me back not just to active addiction but to killer behavior. My intention and desire is to be Off of these prescribed medications as well, but not faster than would be healthy for me personally. The schedule for disengaging varies from person to person I suppose.Â That's why I see a doctor.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/651hvo</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/74jr</id></website><link>http://www.thefix.com/node/2347</link><postedTime>2012-03-15T21:48:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:52:47+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3x4kv</id><link>http://www.thefix.com/node/2347#comment-479694796</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zz58w</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-15</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
