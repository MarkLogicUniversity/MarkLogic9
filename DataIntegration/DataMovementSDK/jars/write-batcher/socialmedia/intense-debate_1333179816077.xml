Claimers are "cheaper" than "good" horses for a myriad of reasons, one of them being a tendency to get nervous in training and before a race. Hypertension is a major cause of EIPH (Bleeding) and this has been explained in lay terms as a drowning-like experience. It is cause and effect and becomes a vicious cycle. Class horses are inherently more relaxed and easier to train than the cheaper claimers. I am with Barry on the Banning of race day meds but suggest we explore the possibility of letting the Claimers race on lasix. After all, they probably need it and would not affect the gene pool. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zvyo4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xz0p</id></website><link>http://www.paulickreport.com/news/ray-s-paddock/irwin-race-day-medication-ban-all-about-perception/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:29:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:20:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwrbct</id><link>http://www.paulickreport.com/news/ray-s-paddock/irwin-race-day-medication-ban-all-about-perception/#comment-480912029</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
