Americans Always desire to fall behind it seems, stubborn and Stiff necked. Such a desire to become a 3rd world nation, rather than lead..we are the onlyÂ industrializedÂ democracy without healthcare.
While Germany has as much as 30% of it's power derived from solar, we have decided to mislead about our natural gas reserves and frack our aquafiers with water and unnamed chemicals.While India, Korea, Brazil and Germany, along with China are moving ahead in energy tech, and the jobs that grow with it, we want more fossil fuel..while we stay mired in inches and yards while the worlds is using the simpler metric system.Highest standards of living in the world?..not in our 50 states. Greed, selfishness and wealth will only continue our slide to 3rd world status, where a few rich rule in total power, wages are low, poverty is extreme, women are 2nd class citizens and govt. wage war freely. That sounds more like judgment than revival
