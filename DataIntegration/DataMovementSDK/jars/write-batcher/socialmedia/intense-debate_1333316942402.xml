Put DeJesus between Stewart and Soto......I don't like Soto hitting 8th but that seems to be the only Spot left. If you put Barney and Castro 1st and 2nd and Soto 3rd (with his power and this being his year,even) he might do well their, and then you put DeJesus 8th.....If everybody performs up to their ability this could possible be a decent year.....The pitching looks pretty good.

On paper doesn't mean much.....On the field is what counts..........LETS GO CUBS!!!!!!!!!!!!
