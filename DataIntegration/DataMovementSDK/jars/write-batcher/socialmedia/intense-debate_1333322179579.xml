I went canoeing with my family in France, and we could have done half the full journey and it would have been lovely and whimsical, 12km, manageable, but dad decided we should be intrepid or something and we did the full 24km. then when we got tired and a bit moany he threw a fit and sulked the rest of the way so we had to do all the paddling and in the morning it poured with rain so all my sun lotion washed Off and then it got really hot but the sun was &lt;i&gt;only on one side&lt;/i&gt; so one side of me was way more Burned than the other and then we left one of our bags at a place we rested and had to go on a weird trip through a camping site we shouldn&amp;#039;t have been in it to retrieve it to have the first drink we&amp;#039;d had in several hours
