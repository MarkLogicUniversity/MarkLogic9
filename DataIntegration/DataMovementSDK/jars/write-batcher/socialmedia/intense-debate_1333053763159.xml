Â can I have some too? LOL.

And yeah, I take your point about how if the stars were to  perfectly.......I'm intensely curious what "their version" of twilight would have/could have been.....betcha it was a really dark and more sexually intense version than what we got...Shivers.... can you imagine??????Â 

As for the question "how often does that happen" (stars ?) Â well............in my mind, I reckon the stars Aligned PERFECTLY on the day those two met......... I know, I know, I'm such a romantic sap, but I can't help it. Â :)) Â those two and the way they are with each other? Â - it warms my heart.Â 

You know, it does make me wonder : if they get two unknowns for this movie (wise decision IMO) , would it skyrocket their careers like it did for R/K? Â  Chances are the movie could be a huge hit, you never know. Â How poetically ironic would that be? Â Lets hope they do get a quality script, director etc, coz if this story is done right, it could be really amazing onscreen. Â Not least because of the sex scenes/love scenes but in the telling of the story of how Ana/Bella heals Christian/Edward - how he overcomes his sad start in life and how she discovers her own strengths, etc. If they really get into the base of this story, it could be fabulous.

Okay, did you get me some peanut butter thingys??
