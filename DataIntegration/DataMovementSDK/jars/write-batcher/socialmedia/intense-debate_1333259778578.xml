Leaving a child inside adds a whole other aspect that carries its own legal prohibition. Even leaving a child in a locked car can bring about legal charges if the child is thereby put in danger, like on a hot Summer day. Children (and pets) die in Overheated cars left in parking lots all too often, thus the 'child endangerment' and 'animal cruelty' charges that reasonably follow from such negligent .

As for the case of young Skylar being left, and allegedly abducted, from his mother's unattended and unlocked vehicle, she still faces potential 'child endangerment' charges. But, the police have publicly stated they have withheld charging her in the hope (by now greatly diminished) that she would cooperate with the investigation. She's not Off the hook and is still subject to being so charged.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/678uf4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmp</id></website><link>http://www.thenewstribune.com/2012/03/30/2088148/puyallup-mother-may-face-citation.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:05:23+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T19:08:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw769d</id><link>http://www.thenewstribune.com/2012/03/30/2088148/puyallup-mother-may-face-citation.html#comment-481083920</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8xzj6</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
