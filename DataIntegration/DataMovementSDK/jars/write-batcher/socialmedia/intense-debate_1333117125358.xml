As anyone who has ever had any kind of cut on their head knows, any head injury Bleeds like crazy. There were no bandages on Zimmermans head. Not even a bandaid. And he climbed out of the back of a police car in handcuffs without any assistance. If you have ever been arrested you know how difficult it is to exit the rear seat of a police car in handcuffs. In most cases the cops give you a hand getting out and also make sure you don't hit your head on the way out.

Especially if you are injured or have a head injury. Get real people. Zimmerman shot Trevon in Cold Blood. This will become clear later on. The fact that they didn't arrest Zimmerman right  the bat is a mystery that will also see the light Off day.
