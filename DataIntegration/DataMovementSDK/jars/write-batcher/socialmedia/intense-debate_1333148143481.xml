Our music has become so lyrically and musically deprived that we have to Â endlessly use Marley's name to attract a crowd to some of these inferior quality musical events. Very few of our present day artists can attract an audience with quality music. Jamaica is Thirsting for quality music .The recent Jazz Festival headlined by Celine Dion is proof of this.The tripe spewed by the musically challenged dance , Off beat, shouters has killed reggae music locally and internationally. The largest selling reggae artist is now a Jewish boy from Brooklyn. Bob Marley must still be beating down Babylon in his grave.
