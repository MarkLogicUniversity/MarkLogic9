Â I thought it was an over-. Â It was a atrocity against the free market system for the sake of convenience. Â I nearly Vomited when the US started buying bonds in private companies and, then, the president of a private company was told to step down by the President of the United States! Â Even though I would have loved to see TARP stricken, I am not sure on what constitutional basis it would have been done. Â  Â 

Obviously, both parties support the patriot  because the 111th could have easily repealed it, but they didn't. Â Obama could have made it a priority, but he hasn't. Â President Obama has since signed executive orders strengthening it; particularly the surveillance by the NSA.

Unfortunately, every  that our sitting President has performed has been to appease foreign governments/peoples or to increase governmental size or Reach into our lives. Â I am of the belief that most things can be done better, cheaper, and faster by private entities...I have seen the government screw up nearly everything it touches.Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6763mx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/f047</id></website><link>http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/legal-challenges/219285-obama-running-against-congress-could-find-new-foe-in-supreme-court</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:36:00+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:42:20+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwkvsx</id><link>http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/legal-challenges/219285-obama-running-against-congress-could-find-new-foe-in-supreme-court#comment-481838421</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
