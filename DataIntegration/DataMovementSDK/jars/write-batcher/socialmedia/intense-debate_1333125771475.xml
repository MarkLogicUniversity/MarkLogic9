â€œJohnâ€&#157; in interview on 27 Feb by Tampa Bay FOX News affiliate: Â â€œThe
 guy on the bottom, who I believe had a red sweater on, was yelling to 
me, â€˜Help.Â  Help.â€™ I told him to stop and I was calling 911â€&#157;â€¦.â€&#157;and then 
when I got upstairs and looked down, the person that was on top, beating
 up the other guy, was the one laying in the grass, and I believe he was
 dead at that point.â€&#157;

911 Call -Audio shows that from the time a woman witness Reached 911 on the phone andÂ  for approximately the next 45 seconds, repeated audible cries 
can be heard in the background.Â Â  During the conversation with the 911 
operator, the female caller describes someone â€œscreaming outsideâ€&#157;. She 
indicates that she believes the person is yelling for help, but she does
 not know why.Â  At about :45 into the call,Â  a loud noise can be heard 
and the caller indicates she has just heard a single gunshot.Â  After 
this point, the screams stop and do not continue.Â  It must be surmised 
that the screaming that the woman heard began at some point before her 
call to 911. 

This matches Zimmerman's account to police.Â  Zimmerman's injuries are also consistent with his version and the versions of these two witnesses.Â  The policeman who arrived first at the scene, when securing Zimmerman's handgun, stated, "While I was in such close contact with Zimmerman, I could observe that 
his back appeared to be wet and was covered in grass, as if he had been 
lying on his back on the ground.Â  Zimmerman was also Bleeding from the 
nose and back of his headâ€¦.Zimmerman was placed in the rear of my police
 vehicle and was given first aid by the SFD....Once Zimmerman was 
cleared by the SFD, he was transported to the Sanford Police 
Department.â€&#157;
