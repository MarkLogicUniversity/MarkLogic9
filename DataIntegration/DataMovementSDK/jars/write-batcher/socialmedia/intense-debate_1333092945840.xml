So "Devil" is just the human being manifestation or action of one against truth or falsehood. Its those with the lack of understanding that try and make this a religion or race thing...when in fact its just a God &amp; Satan thing! Satan's are the thinkers, the great minds of trickknowledgy or deception...The House of Rothchilds etc...the ones who orchestrated the worlds dominance and control over the world. The "Devils" are the one who carry out Satan's orders...i.e. Military, The Feds, A.T.F, Swat, C.I.A etc...your starting to get the picture now right...the minions are the lowest on the todempole...these are the Cops, the people that only care about self  and do things to others because they see a benefit or self Gain so they commit crimes against the innocent people of the planet...I hope you understand me thus far.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hvfef</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rb19</id></website><link>/2012/03/28/spooky-louis-farrakhan-audio-you-will-not-believe/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T15:44:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:42:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m39q1o</id><link>/2012/03/28/spooky-louis-farrakhan-audio-you-will-not-believe/#comment-479929132</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zh700</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
