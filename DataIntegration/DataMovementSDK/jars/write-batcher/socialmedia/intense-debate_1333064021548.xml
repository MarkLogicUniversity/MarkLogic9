Let me make a guess..THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS HAD IT WITH HER SPENDING 'OUR MONEY' AS FAST AS SHE CAN.Â  We are OUTRAGED that she has done little to nothing except to TRAVEL on our DIME and appear on as many TV shows as she can, including bringing her wimpy excuse to show Off her Weight loss to the W H.Â  Potato races indeed! Â  And I will say it again...if anyone had at their disposal 35 plus a ides and round the clock servants to cook and a live in trainer plus as many 'spa visits' as she wants, again all on OUR DIME, losing weight would be a breeze.Â  Let's throw massages in there.Â  

She doesn't have the normal responsibilities that most of us do....having to clock in at work or even being home to take care of the little ones.Â  I would like to see a fiscal report on just exactly how much her traveling and 'new' life style has cost us taxpayers.Â  It is obnoxious and vulgar and the American People have had enough.
