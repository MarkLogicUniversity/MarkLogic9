I was 14 years old and remember it well. It makes sense that the WWE would allow both men to Bleed for this particular match, but I don't see it happening. Sure Callaway and Levesque have MAJOR pull in the company, but with Linda running for the Senate again and the recent product shift towards less "risque" content, it's wishful thinking that these 2 will Bleed. Though I may be wrong. Afterall, the Rock's promos are straight from the Attitude Era.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zhwwq</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/eyjq</id></website><link>http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/03/at-wrestlemania-xxviii-will-there-be-blood/255217/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:49:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T07:19:34+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw9f9n</id><link>http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/03/at-wrestlemania-xxviii-will-there-be-blood/255217/#comment-481616588</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ac5pw</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
