Im in agreement . Keep up the civil attempt at confronting the misinformation and biased talk. If it is proven that Zimmerman was a Cold blooded killer then he should be put away. If it is proven that he was actually Acting in self defense at the time that there was a confrontation/assault then that should be taken into CONSIDERATION. 
On a different note-Spike Lee should be brought up on charges for incitement when he posted more than once what he ASSUMEDÂ  was Zimmerman's home address. 
He should be SUED by the folks at that address for the ordeal they are currently going through too. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h31z1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rbz6</id></website><link>http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2012/03/surveillance_video_of_george_z.php</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T23:55:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:33:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3tg96</id><link>http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2012/03/surveillance_video_of_george_z.php#comment-479491138</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
