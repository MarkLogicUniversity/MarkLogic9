I assume not, unless you are the usual western coward who Cheers such crimes on CNN brainwashing channel with a beer in your hand from the safety of your living room as long as it's not happening to you.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z6o7i</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/opinion/bergen-nato-afghan-friendly-fire/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T12:15:25+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:42:07+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3kujb</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/opinion/bergen-nato-afghan-friendly-fire/index.html#comment-480167698</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ctska</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
