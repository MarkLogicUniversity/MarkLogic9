I start soaking rice about half an hour before I begin preparing the rest of the meal. About an hour in Cold water is enough for white rice to cook in less than 10 minutes and brown rice in less than 15. Also, if you use 2x water depth to rice, then the rice absorbs all the water in the pan. Use boiling water from the kettle and a covered pan and you can turn the Heat Off after the first 5 minutes and leave it boiling on its own until it has absorbed all the water. I allow a bit longer doing it this way but it can't Burn as there's no Heat and it just sits in the pan staying hot until the rest of the meal is ready.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yvsre</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/thxi</id></website><link>http://grist.org/food/a-simple-recipe-that-could-change-the-way-you-look-at-rice/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T12:12:36+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T12:11:36+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwimvz</id><link>http://grist.org/food/a-simple-recipe-that-could-change-the-way-you-look-at-rice/#comment-481779518</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gx4pl</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
