Nice explanation!  I managed a vet clinic for 15 years and got so Burnt out by this dilemma!  I worried over the staff not being paid enough, I worried over the animals suffering because their people couldn't pay for needed care.  It was terribly stressful.  My daughter recently graduated from vet school and is a practicing vet who works long hours and has incredibly high student loans to pay Off.  I understand that this is a calling.  I was called to work in this field and loved it.  My daughter loves it as well, but it is a tough way to make a living. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/dia1cl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/bhxi</id></website><link>http://www.askavetquestion.com/why-are-vets-so-expensive.php</link><postedTime>2012-01-10T19:52:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T00:15:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwxaom</id><link>http://www.askavetquestion.com/why-are-vets-so-expensive.php#comment-481352263</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-01-10</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
