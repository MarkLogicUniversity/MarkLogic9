I in my 37 years have seen the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and the " middle class" pretty much disappear.So for all you that think that we should all give bigger tax breaks to the rich. B.S. I went from middle class to the poor in the matter of 5 years. So to all the rich that are getting richer, this is from one of the middle class that is no longer the middle class, but into the poor getting poorer Spot. We worked our butts Off as well and you think you should have a bigger tax break because you are rich NO WAY. i have been filing taxes since i was sixteen and the 21 years I have been filing it seems as if my tax breaks have just disappeared .  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/yn4mhx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zmtw</id></website><link>http://front.moveon.org/the-best-quote-from-barack-obama-weve-seen-this-week/</link><postedTime>2012-02-16T18:05:17+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:13:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwljj4</id><link>http://front.moveon.org/the-best-quote-from-barack-obama-weve-seen-this-week/#comment-480966030</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7eek</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-02-16</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
