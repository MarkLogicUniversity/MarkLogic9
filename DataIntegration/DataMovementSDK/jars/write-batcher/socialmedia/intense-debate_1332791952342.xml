The real story is about an over zellous person who took the law in to his own hands. He should be prosecuted for 2nd degree murder since he chased down the victim. He was the 1st aggressor and therefore it is NOT a case of self defense.Â 


Now it has become a racial issue and we have a $10,000 Bounty on theÂ aggressorsÂ head by The New Black Panthers. They have Spotted theÂ opportunityÂ to spread violence and hatred and are subscribing to the same idea of vigilante justice that caused this issue.Â 


It looks like President Obama is on his way to preside over the worst racial violence that this country has ever seen. This willÂ unfortunatelyÂ derail any chance of his getting reelected and continuing the work that he started.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r0w00</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/justice/florida-teen-shooting-poll/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:18:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:52:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkjpor</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/justice/florida-teen-shooting-poll/index.html#comment-476629643</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/d8uz2</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
