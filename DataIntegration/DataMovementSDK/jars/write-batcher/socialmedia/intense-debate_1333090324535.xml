If Tom Brady gets sacked and comes up a little sore he has the opportunity to take an aspirin or  at half time. Thoroughbreds are no different and every case should be documented and treated on an individual basis. Medication should be allowed only an individual basis and documented in racing form. Medication isn't killing the industry the lack ofÂ preparationÂ and promotion is. Racing needs to be brought back into the national Spot light. The only way this will happen is by decreasing the amount of racing which will increase the quality of the sport and allow for for medication to be regulated on a national basis. Once the product is restored then it will be able to be promoted and Gain popularity.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zvyo4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xz0p</id></website><link>http://www.paulickreport.com/news/ray-s-paddock/irwin-race-day-medication-ban-all-about-perception/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:29:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:21:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m395a9</id><link>http://www.paulickreport.com/news/ray-s-paddock/irwin-race-day-medication-ban-all-about-perception/#comment-479908862</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
