I've done really well on a low-carb diet when working from home. When out on business, in cities, or commuting long distances, it's staggering just how much restaurant, takeaway, or supermarket food is stacked full of sugar and other carbs.

I travel for days at a time with work, often by air, so can't pack up much to take with me beyond a few packets of almonds. A few decent takeaway restaurants have plain, non-pasta salads, but on a Cold day there's a limit to how many plain chicken or prawn salads you can eat. 

And 'working lunches'Â are almost Always big plates of sandwiches followed by biscuits. 

The only decent, low-carb meal you can get whilst travelling is a good old cooked breakfast. Excuse me whilst I order my third breakfast of the day.....</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lp1z5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/dietandfitness/9169229/Will-the-Dukan-Diet-lose-its-attraction.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T19:11:26+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:56:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3fnih</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/dietandfitness/9169229/Will-the-Dukan-Diet-lose-its-attraction.html#comment-479883973</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8ds9a</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
