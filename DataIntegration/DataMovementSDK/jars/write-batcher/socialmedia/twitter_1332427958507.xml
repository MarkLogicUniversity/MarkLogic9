I am from a small country town in the Great State of Georgia, A Ga. Peach born and raised, BUT If I wasn't from Ga. I would want to move here. We have home grown MANY great artist here and Phillip is one of our best. A Simple GOOD OLE COUNTY Boy, Georgia Born, Georgia Raised and now READY To share his gift to the World..He Will Â STAY Simple and true and soon he will Be THE BEST Artist Discovered on American Idol by Far.... The other 9 will fall one by one till its done-What ever the order may be of each one going home is in the end irrelevant THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE to WIN AI2012 and THAT WILL BE .....PHILLIP PHILLIPS.....</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ymhq2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mmtc</id></website><link>http://americanidolnet.com/american-idol-2012-top-10-performances-recap/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T02:42:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T13:54:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mpwosh</id><link>http://americanidolnet.com/american-idol-2012-top-10-performances-recap/#comment-473595853</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
