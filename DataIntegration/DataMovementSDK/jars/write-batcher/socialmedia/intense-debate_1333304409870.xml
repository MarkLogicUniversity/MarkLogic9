1. Gomez earned the 5th Spot but if he is injured how do you hand it to Slowey? He has been awful. They should outright release Slowey (eat his contract, it was stupid to stupid signing anyway) and insert Barnes in the rotation, he earned it. 
2. J Lopez has earned a Spot, let Donald serve as a backup CF. The backup CF position will not play much anyway, if there is an injury make a roster move. 
3. Wheeler is an absolute joke, 11.70 Era/ Nick Hagadone earned that Spot. So what if we have three lefties in the pen?  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67vrkv</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27763086%26vkey=news_cle%26c_id=cle</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:07:21+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T12:38:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwixab</id><link>http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27763086%26vkey=news_cle%26c_id=cle#comment-481797130</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/52si9</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
