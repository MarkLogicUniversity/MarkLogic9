It doesnt matter whether he was legally a "kid".It only matters what level of force he had available to him. he was tall and an athlete. Negroes mature faster than other races. Lebron was on the cover of SI as a HS JUNIOR! The cover said he could play in the NBA today! A 16 year old black male who could PLAY IN THE NBA!!!! What do you think would happen if he had attacked an average adult,like YOU,Carbon Mike,(altho calling you "average" is a bit charitable)? This is what would happen:you'd be Bleeding like a stuck pig,your eye socket smashed,jaw smashed,possibly paralyzed,facing 1/2 million $$ in medical bills. This Trayvon jerk--and he WAS a worthless good for nothing jerk,(his parents smellingMONEY now.)---tho no LeBron,was mopst likely a veteran of many fights and could easily overpower an older,untrained male. I cant believe the idiotic,moronic way you Pampered,bottle-fed,pussified,white panzies blubber on about how easy it would be to fight a 17 year old ghetto nigga. You would be terrified. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6dpkfb</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/eyjq</id></website><link>http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/12/03/trayvon-martins-killer-was-looking-for-trouble-and-found-it/254815/</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T15:01:06+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T20:36:40+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/migiy8</id><link>http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/12/03/trayvon-martins-killer-was-looking-for-trouble-and-found-it/254815/#comment-473924198</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hplu3</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
