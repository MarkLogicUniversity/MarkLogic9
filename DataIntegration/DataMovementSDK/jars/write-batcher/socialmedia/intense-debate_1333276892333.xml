THE MURDERER: Â  he was charged with resisting arrest with VIOLENCE &amp;  ON A POLICE OFFICER Â (there was a proven physical scuffle between he and a cop! charges this serious dropped??? Â  maybe because of DADDY JUDGE! Â this is a felony and had a been charged with, he would not be able to legally obtain a gun!), neighbors said he was fixated on crime and focused on young, black males
Â and he has been the subject of complaints for "aggressive tacticsâ€&#157; by his neighbors!
HE HAS AN ANGER MANAGEMENT PROBLEM! Â Â 

Trayvon has no criminal record! and whatever happened at school with suspension, weed, or whatever is done by white &amp; black teens all across america! Â white teens have pictures where they look like thugs, have gold teeth and tattoos also!

this child's body lay in the medical examiner's office for 3 days WHEN POLICE HAD HIS CELL PHONE &amp; DID NOT CALL ANY OF HIS #s! Â as his father called his son's phone looking for his son! Â police purposely marked him as a john doe when they knew who he was. Â WHY? Â  Â Â 

his head was repeatedly bashed on concrete per father, brothers and others. his lawyer said he needed stitches but when he saw a doc about 2 or 3 days later, there was no need tor stitches because the wound was healing. they say z was cleaned up at the crime scene but there was no bandage on his head, or no visible injuries! back was not wet or stained!no blood on clothes. police said they confiscated his clothes yet witnesses described him in those clothes he had on in the police video!

daddy judge first said tray attacked murderer while murderer was still in his car. Â now daddy judge is saying as tray had him on the ground beating the crap out of the murderer, z's gun was exposed accidently and tray went after the gun saying "you are going to die tonight".
his lawyer said he was on his way to the grocery store, then that was changed to Target.
1) Â  Â TRAY'S Â FATHER SAID THE ORIGINAL STORY FROM POLICE WAS Z WAS PULLING OUT HIS PHONE WHEN TRAY PUNCHED HIM AND KNOCKED HIM TO THE GROUND, GOT ON TOP OF Z AND PINNED HIS ARMS DOWN WITH HIS KNEES COVERED HIS MOUTH, TOLD HIM TO SHUT UP AND BEGAN PUNCHING HIM.
2) Â  Â  Â a so-called witness says Â trayvon walked up to him and asked z if he had a problem. z says no. trayvon says you do now and punched him in the face breaking his nose. Â this is not how these kids operate! but its funny when you imagine it.Â 
3) Â  Â  some other so-called witness WHO JUST CAME FORTH IN THE LAST 3 DAYS, said "Z asked the suspect what he was doing here. TRAYVON CHOSE TO NOT RESPECT AN ADULT AND "SUCKER PUNCHED HIM FROM BEHIND" and started slamming his head into the pavement"

so-called witness says z did not use a slur. says z said "Punks" which was verified by voice analysis" Â when and in what article did it say this? I have not heard or seen it! Â 
this joe oliver character Â was asked about it &amp; he said the word was "GOON" &amp; not a slur.this joe oliver character also said his 17 year old daughter who i assume is black like he is, says "GOON" is a "term of endearment used among their age group. my teen black niece looked at me like I had two heads when I asked her about what this joe oliver character said.
the murderers brother said "he did not use a racial slur. in fact, heÂ 

evidence available that has been reviewed is the same evidence available the night this child was shot down in Cold blood! once JEB BUSH and others said publicly the stand your ground law does not apply to this idiot chasing a child down &amp; shooting him, the story began to change to fit a SELF DEFENSE CLAIM!

if your head is being bashed on concrete, who thinks "let me move my head onto the grass so i won't end up in diapers!" THIS IS WHAT BROTHER, WHO HAS NOT SPOKEN TO MURDERER IN YEARS, SAID MURDERER SAID. most would try to push Â the basher Off of them or try to get up or both!

Prior to the release of the 911 tapes, Â  ZIMMERMAN'S FATHER Â  Â  Â  Â  Â (DADDY JUDGE!) Â  Â  Â  released a statement claiming Â  â€œat no time did George follow or confront Mr. Martin.â€&#157;
Dispatcher: â€œAre you following him?â€&#157;
Zimmerman: â€œYeahâ€&#157;
Dispatcher: â€œOK, we donâ€™t need you to do that Â Â 
and he is telling lies again!

whats crazy also is Obama is also a victim of racial profiling and at the same time being accused of promoting hate and dividing the country

this is the fault of Â GORGE ZIMMERMAN murderer &amp; felon, BROTHER who has not spoken to his violent murdering brother in years, daddy judge ROBERT ZIMMERMAN who first said tray attacked the murderer as he sat in his car, the proven corrupt SANFORD POLICE DEPT, uncle tom NELSON BONAPARTE JR. city manager, Â ANGELA COREY state attorney and republican says all, BILL LEE chief of police, JOE OLIVER so-called friend,Â
