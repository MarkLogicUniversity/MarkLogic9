I'm giong to throw up.Â  Aren't we sick of choosing the lessor of two evils the establishment constantly allows us to pick from??Â Â  Stop falling for this insider, status quo crap, people!!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6znloz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rb19</id></website><link>/2012/03/29/mitt-romney-make-another-elitist-faux-pas/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:29:44+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:37:55+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3jx7e</id><link>/2012/03/29/mitt-romney-make-another-elitist-faux-pas/#comment-479978034</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzq0q</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
