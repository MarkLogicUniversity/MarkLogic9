you are Spot on, you don't have to be sorry, as Prince Phillip once said,if it is not fit for purpose it is made in India!

Absolutely, they love the jargon,the red tape and showing s to how important they are.
Every time I go there I seethe with rage when the airport officials suck their teeth, shake their heads and come up with something quite outrageous,which they deem to be essential,before you can leave/enter the country.
I know when the call centres are in that country you can not expect anything sensible.
Once when I had just got my iphone, I inadvertently flicked the switch which controls the sound. I rang the help line which was based in India. One bored operator told me 'just take the  out and re start". Iphone has built in Battery,you can not remove it, I rang Orange Â UK, and they were horrified at the advise given.
I rest my case.
As for the passports, am not sure where they are, we have moved house since,they probably are somewhere in the papers in the loft, the rest of the certificates and important papers are filed and are safe!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lalqf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ms5w</id></website><link>http://my.telegraph.co.uk/sabinaa/sabinaa/16105548/incredible-india/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:24:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:36:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkjqrg</id><link>http://my.telegraph.co.uk/sabinaa/sabinaa/16105548/incredible-india/#comment-476616065</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a3gi3</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
