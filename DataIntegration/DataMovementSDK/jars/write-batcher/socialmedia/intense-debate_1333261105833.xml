Her daughter was there and twice was taken to the hospital that night when she herself overdosed with drugs and alcohol!!

Coroner: ... the results indicated Houston was a chronic cocaine user.

Meanwhile the Los Angeles City Council passed today a resolution 15 to 2 against free speech and in this case accurate speech against KFI radio hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou The two had been suspended for referring to Whitney Houston as a â€œcrack hoâ€&#157; in February shortly after she died.

A couple of articles I read said she had taken several drugs. The toxicology tests found marijuana, the anti-Anxiety drug Xanax, the muscle relaxant Flexeril and the allergy medicine Benadryl.

Then said.... But these drugs "did not contribute to the death!!!!

There sure helped her along as did her friends and family!</body><verb>delete</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ypvj9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ju4p</id></website><link>http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2012/03/22/Whitney-Houston-died-of-accidental-drowning--reports</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T22:17:25+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T00:05:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miy5pp</id><link>http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2012/03/22/Whitney-Houston-died-of-accidental-drowning--reports#comment-474077873</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hoflp</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>killed</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
