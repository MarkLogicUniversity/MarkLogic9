I saw this pic series on Pinterest where they're like:

Jilllian: Hey did ContestantName just throw up?
Bob: Yup. You know why? because I'm just that good.

And yes, I'm totally down with TeamJillian - she's my kinda gal.  Before I even watched the show I had a conversation with my co-workers where I went, "Dude, she totally used to be fat."
And they were all, "How do you know?" (while immediately google-ing to see if it was true)
Me: "Because I got sixty pounds Off my own arse that says you don't get like that unless you're afraid of going back. I can Spot my own kind."

But yay on the gym-attendance -- what are you doing for cardio? And most importantly - is there a heart rate monitor in play? ;)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6dmmw7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/u6nr</id></website><link>http://heroineaddict.me/and-if-all-of-that-had-happened-it-would-be-bad/</link><postedTime>2012-03-20T21:58:11+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:45:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi5wc2</id><link>http://heroineaddict.me/and-if-all-of-that-had-happened-it-would-be-bad/#comment-473882508</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ry6j1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-20</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
