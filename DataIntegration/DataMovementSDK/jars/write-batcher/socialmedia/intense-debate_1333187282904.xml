Wow... there you go generalizing an entire race. That's like me saying let me watch out for old white men because they'd either rape me or molest and murder my child. That's ignorant. You can't use the things that the media is pushingabout Trayvon to justify Zimmerman murdering him.Do you know what your children do or say when you're not around? He is a teenager that is bound to make mistakes... believe me we all do... but thats doesn't mean that he should be dead today at the age of 17... At the time of his death was he climbing in/out of a window... did he rob Zimmerman of his wallet... was he being a thug lying dead on the grass... be realistic and please stop Reaching for excuses to justify Zimmerman murdering in Cold blood... Zimmermans past is not an issue with me... its what he did that night</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zrph8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/opinion/whitaker-in-depth-martin/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:09:39+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:54:43+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwlhav</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/opinion/whitaker-in-depth-martin/index.html#comment-480946948</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zrvj8</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
