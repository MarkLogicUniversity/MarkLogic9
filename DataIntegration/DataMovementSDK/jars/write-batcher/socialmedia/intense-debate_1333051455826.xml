I'm sure someone has informed the "O" that he is in sheep dip and better do some compromising in a hurry or the people are going to sink his battleship. ( this is the one mistake slick willie did not make- he realized there was a limit how far he could stick his neck out without losing it)

So if the "O" backtracks and makes corrections big enough to really change things to take the Heat Off of him he has to alienate and infuriate his liberal base.

Thats a bad catch-22 situation for him to be in ( and I love it)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zr054</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/jeffrey-toobin/2012/03/29/cnn-hard-imagine-how-things-could-be-going-worse-obama-administration</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:17:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:24:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3tadi</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/jeffrey-toobin/2012/03/29/cnn-hard-imagine-how-things-could-be-going-worse-obama-administration#comment-479485326</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6f7j5</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
