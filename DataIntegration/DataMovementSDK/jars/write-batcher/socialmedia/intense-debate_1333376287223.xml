An alternative proposal would be to install lifts for the disabled and those with children on all underground platforms. And fenced 'safe' lanes where small kids are safe from idiot commuters clouting them on the head with said satchels, or knocking them over on the escalator in an effort to save 5 minutes. I would also install a priority boarding system and dedicated carriages on rush hour trains for those with small children or a disability. And a system where train commuters can reclaim half their ticket money if they are forced to stand. I would install a monitoring task force on tubes to Ensure people offer their seats to the elderly, disabled, pregnant or those with children and instigate Spot fines for those who do not.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/62wtlg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mxvm</id></website><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-banned-list-10-annoying-things-that-should-be-illegal-7554526.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-11T00:11:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-12T09:09:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/muo6l0</id><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-banned-list-10-annoying-things-that-should-be-illegal-7554526.html#comment-463214195</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hw0i1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-11</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
