As a beltway journalist, you are among the last group ofÂ people Harper would consider himself close enough to bring into his personal life.

As such, it should not be a surprise that your description of the "private" Harper just happens to perfectly Align with the meme the beltway journos have ascribed to him.Â  It also just happens to be a default trait that those on the left ascribe to conservatives generally.
