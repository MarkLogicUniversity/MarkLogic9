The status quo supports the progressive Wislonian style foreign policy, entitlements, growth of government in size, spending and intrusiveness into our lives. It was progressives who brought us all the abuses of the Interstate Commerce Clause, the General Welfare clause, and the Necessary and Proper Clause. The progressives also brought us the 16th Amendment, the Federal Reserve System, the League of Nations and the United Nations. Progressives/status quo scumbags ALL support John Maynard Keynes economic policies.
Whats next? You'll try to make a disctinction between new style conservatives and progressives and or liberals? They are ALL collectivists no matter what their rhetoric.

Wilson said "we need to use our military to make the world safe for democracy".

"Democracy is like two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for supper. Liberty is two wolves and a well armed lamb contesting the vote" Ben Franklin

"Democracy is mob rule. It's tyranny but of the majority where 51% of the voters can vote away the rights of the other 49% may it never be" Thomas Jefferson

What do Wilson, Gingrich, Santorum, Bush, Obama,Clinton and Romney all have in common? They all want to make the world safe for a system that our founding fathers detested with the use of our sons but not their own.

Meanwhile they abandoned the foreign policy of the old style conservaqtives and the founding fathers. Those that support the founding fathers are called "isolationists" like the progressives called the old style conservatives when they opposed Wilson's and FDR's war mongering.




â€œMy ardent desire is, and my aim has been... to comply
strictly with all our engagements foreign and domestic; but to keep the U
States free from political connections with every other Country. To see that
they may be independent of all, and under the influence of none. In a word, I
want an American character, that the powers of Europe may be convinced we 
for ourselves and not for others; this, in my judgment, is the only way to be
respected abroad and happy at homeâ€&#157;. George Washington, letter to Patrick
Henry, October 9, 1775 



â€œMy policy has been, and will continue to be, while I have
the honor to remain in the administration of the government, to be upon
friendly terms with, but independent of, all the nations of the earth. To share
in the broils of none. To fulfill our own engagements. To supply the wants, and
be carriers for them all: Being thoroughly convinced that it is our policy and
interest to do soâ€&#157;.Â  George Washington,
letter to Gouverneur Morris, December 22, 1790 



â€œObserve good faith and justice towards all Nations. Cultivate
peace and harmony with allâ€&#157;.George Washington, Farewell Address, September 19,
1790 



"Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I
conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens,) the jealousy of a free people
ought to be constantly awake; since history and experience prove, that foreign
influence is one of the most baneful foes of Republican Government. But that
jealousy, to be useful, must be impartial; else it becomes the instrument of
the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defence against it. Excessive
partiality for one foreign nation, and excessive dislike of another, cause
those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and
even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may resist
the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to become suspected and odious; while
its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to
surrender their interests." 


Congressman Howard H. Buffett,
(R-Nebraska), the Midwestern campaign manager for "Mr. Republican"
Senator Robert Taft in 1952, was a leading opponent of America's increasingly
interventionist policies, foreign and domestic, during the 1930s, 1940s and
1950s. Criticizing the proposal of FDR's Secretary of the Interior (whose
bailiwick, one would have thought, could not extend beyond the then-forty-eight
states) to build a $165m oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Buffett stated on 24
March 1944 "it would terminate the inspiring period of America's history
as a great nation not resorting to intercontinental imperialism. This venture
would end the influence exercised by the United States as a government not
participating in the exploitation of small lands and countries â€¦ It may be that
the American people would rather forego the use of a questionable amount of
gasoline at some time in the remote future than follow a foreign policy
practically guaranteed to send many of their sons â€¦ to die in faraway places in
defense of the trade of Standard Oil or the international dreams of our
one-world planners."ã€€ã€€ Congressman Buffett was a staunch
anti-Communist who nevertheless questioned the morality as well as the efficacy
of America's Cold War crusade. He declared "our Christian ideals cannot be
exported to other lands by dollars and guns. Persuasion and example are the
methods taught by the Carpenter of Nazareth â€¦ We cannot practice might and
force abroad and retain freedom at home. We cannot talk co-operation and
practice power politics â€¦"ã€€ã€€ 



â€œI have Always given it as my decided opinion that no nation
had a right to inter-meddle in the internal concerns of another; and that, if
this country could, consistent with its engagements, maintain a strict
neutrality and thereby preserve peaceâ€&#157;. George Washington - Letter to James
Monroe, August 25, 1796 

â€œObserve good faith and justice toward all nations.
Cultivate peace and harmony with all. ...The nation which indulges toward
another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave.
It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is
sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interestâ€&#157;. George Washington
- Farewell Address, September 17, 1797 

â€œPeace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations,
entangling alliances with none should be our mottoâ€&#157;. Thomas Jefferson - First
Inaugural Address, March 4, 1801 

â€œIf there be one principle more deeply rooted than any other
in the mind of every American, it is that we should have nothing to do with
conquestâ€&#157;. Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) Letter to William Short, 1791 

â€œWe certainly cannot deny to other nations that principle
whereon our own government is founded, that every nation has a right to govern
itself internally under what forms it pleases, and to change these forms at its
own willâ€&#157;. Thomas Jefferson - To Thomas Pinckney, December 30, 1792 



â€œThe constitution vests the power of declaring war in
Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken
until after they shall have deliberated upon the subject and authorized such a
measureâ€&#157;.Â  George Washington 

An elective despotism was not the government we fought
for;Â  but one in which the powers of
government should be so divided and balanced among the several bodies of
magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limits without being
effectually checked and restrained by the others.James Madison, Federalist No.
58, 1788
