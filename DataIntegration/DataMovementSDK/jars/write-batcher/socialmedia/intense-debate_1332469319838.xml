Hence Lame Game. It was made because they expected her to be the frontrunner and aired to prevent any chance of a delegate revolt.

If the MSM were about bucks over politics, they'd take MSNBC  the air and gut the editorial staffs of every major newspaper. They're Bleeding viewers/readers because of their lefttist, lockstep agenda--but they continue. They Always somehow manage to get cash infusions anyway. They're too useful idiot to fail.

They fear Sarah Palin like no other. The talking head drones might believe their own propaganda, but those who wag the dog know better. Why would they relentlessly try to destroy her if they wanted her to run??Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yritp</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7e99</id></website><link>http://conservatives4palin.com/2012/03/open-thread-252.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T06:48:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T01:20:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miy0hh</id><link>http://conservatives4palin.com/2012/03/open-thread-252.html#comment-474117457</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5kezu</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
