I love their Anxiety when they realize they have no skills and their life has no meaning.

The masses are stupid, physically out of shape, sometimes incredibly ugly (I HATE UGLY PEOPLE), and Always have no respect for higher spiritual values.

I love to see their fear of knowing that they suck ... at everything and are inferior beings in every sense.  I love it.

I love being in college, seeing the losers around me enjoy their few years of partying before they enter the prison work camp of post industrial society.  

Their decaying bodies working at a meaningless job, looking for that next tasty meal or fornication section to give them an escape.  MMMmmmh yes!  I want to update my facebook and look at that sexy porn star, twitter, text, I need it !

It makes me laugh, because I'm going to be a doctor.  I plan on purposely committing malpractice, killing many of my patients. What are you?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z6wye</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/e57v</id></website><link>http://www.alternativeright.com/main/blogs/untimely-observations/balkanization-and-the-state-of-exception/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T12:24:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T11:09:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwgvsy</id><link>http://www.alternativeright.com/main/blogs/untimely-observations/balkanization-and-the-state-of-exception/#comment-480625353</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hhqmu</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
