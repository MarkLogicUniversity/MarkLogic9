He has consistently taken wickets and  bowls his full quota of overs. Razzaqs bowling has become a liability. He cant complete his full quota as he starts getting hammered. You cant keep him in the team purely for his batting as he will come Off once in a while like Afridi. Also he is very suspect against top class quicks and leg spinners. Personally, i feel the allrounder in the team needs to atleast fill up one permanent Spot. Afridi is doing that with the ball. Unfortunately Razzaq is neither a specialist batsman nor a specialist bowler. His inclusion disturbs the balance of the team.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l4tax</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/16lc</id></website><link>http://blogs.thenews.com.pk/blogs/2012/03/27/why-waste-our-best-allrounder/</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T10:06:51+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T08:26:08+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3hiw6</id><link>http://blogs.thenews.com.pk/blogs/2012/03/27/why-waste-our-best-allrounder/#comment-479337202</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
