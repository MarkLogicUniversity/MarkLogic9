during his Cairo speech, said:   
"I know, too, that Islam has  been a part 
of  America 's story." 

 AN AMERICAN 
CITIZEN'S RESPONSE: 

  
Dear Mr. Obama: 

Were those 
Mu slims that were in America when the Pilgrims 
first landed?  Funny, I thought they were 
Native American Indians. 

Were those 
Mu slims that celebrated the first Thanksgiving 
day?  Sorry again, those were Pilgrims and 
Native American Indians. 

Can you 
show me one Mu slim signature on the United 
States Constitution? 

  
Declaration 
of Independence ? 

Bill of 
Rights? 

  
Didn't 
think so. 

  
Did 
Mu slims fight for this country's freedom from 
England ?  No. 

  
Did 
Mu slims fight during the Civil War to free the 
slaves in America ?  No, they did 
not.  In fact, Mu slims to this day are 
still the largest traffickers in human 
slavery..  Your own half brother, a devout 
Mu slim, still advocates slavery himself, even 
though Mu slims of Arabic descent refer to bl ack 
Mu slims as "pug nosed slaves."  Says a lot 
of what the Mu slim world really thinks of your 
family's "rich Islamic heritage," doesn't it Mr. 
Obama? 

  
Where were 
Mu slims during the Civil Rights  of this 
country?  Not present. 

  
There are 
no pictures or media accounts of Mu slims walking 
side by side with Martin Luther King, Jr. or 
helping to advance the cause of Civil 
Rights. 

  
Where were 
Mu slims during this country's Woman's Suffrage 
?  Again, not present.  In fact, 
devout Mu slims demand that women are subservient 
to men in the Islamic culture.  So much so, 
that often they are beaten for not wearing the 
'hajib' or for talking to a man who is not a 
direct family member or their husband.  
Yep, the Mu slims are all for women's rights, 
aren't they? 

  
Where were 
Mu slims during World War II?  They were 
 with Adolf Hit ler.  The Mu slim 
grand mufti himself met with Adolf Hit ler, 
reviewed the troops and accepted support from 
the Na zi's in kil ling Je ws. 

  
Finally, 
Mr. Obama, where were Mu slims on Sept. 11th, 
2001?  If they weren't flying planes into 
the World Trade Center , the Pentagon or a field 
in Pennsylvania kil ling nearly 3,000 people on 
our own soil, they were rejoicing in the Middle 
East .  No one can dispute the pictures 
shown from all parts of the Mu slim world 
celebrating on CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and other 
cable news networks that day.  Strangely, 
the very "moderate" Mu slims who's as ses you bent 
over backwards to kiss in Cairo , Egypt on June 
4th were stone Cold silent post 9-11.  To 
many Americans, their silence has meant approval 
for the Acts of that day. 

  
And THAT, Mr. 
Obama, is the "rich heritage" Mu slims have here 
in America .. 

  
Oh, I'm sorry, I 
forgot to mention the Barbary Pirates.  
They were Mu slim. 

  
And now we can 
add November 5, 2009 - the slau ghter of American 
soldiers at Fort Hood by a Mu slim major who is a 
doctor and a psychiatrist who was supposed to be 
counseling soldiers returning from battle in 
Iraq and Afghanistan .. 

  
That, Mr. Obama 
is the "Mu slim heritage" in America</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/672v7h</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/03/30/bin-laden-lived-nine-years-undetected-in-pakistan-fathered-four-children/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T09:59:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:34:23+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwr35l</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/03/30/bin-laden-lived-nine-years-undetected-in-pakistan-fathered-four-children/#comment-480926316</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/yy8m1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
