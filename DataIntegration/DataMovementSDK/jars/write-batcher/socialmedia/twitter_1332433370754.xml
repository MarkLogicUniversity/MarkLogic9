is that certain things the world take for granted once constituted a
monumental and near-insurmountable challenge. Today,  people
live in the South Pole or polar extremeties of the world. It's very
impressive, interesting and commendable that Charles Moore delivered this centennial, commemorative article.
 
But, a century ago, it was almost an impossible dream as some
members of the British polar expedition faced incredible odds
to get to the South Pole and got fatally hammered by the
Cold blizzard.

The story of Captain Lawrence Oates is a great one. Captain
Robert Falcon Scott was the more recognizable of the heroic
crew of the ill-fated expedition. This wss a major fatalistic 
tragedy a century ago.

The year 1912 was one defined by the ill-fated South Pole 
expedition, and, of course the Titanic, almost a month later. 
It's commendable to commemorate the South Pole expedition
a century later.
