Im a normal person I just graduated hs a year ago im 19 and i dont do any drugs. I mean.. I smoke bud every here and there but nothing worse than that. But one day I was standing in my kitchen and I waking a pb and J sandwich and I kept feeling the condo building i live in moving as if it was swaying like a tall tower does. But there are only 3 floors and this building is not that tall and its longÂ horizontally. But yeah i finished making the sandwich madd quick b/c i was sketching b/c i felt the building swaying and so i picked up my sandwich(it was on a napkin) and i turned to my right and took one step and next thing you know my sandwich was back where it was before i picked it up and i was like dropped right back where i was standing when making the sandwich... my eyes were open and everything but everything happend fast in a flash. It was like a black flash.. if that even makes sense. everything turned black for a fraction of a second and i standing in the Spot i was in seconds ago and my pb and j was put back. -____- dont believe me if you dont wanna.. but i aint lieing. I've even had an instance where I was in the middle of class and my pencil just rocked forward Off of my desk and my friends were like..
