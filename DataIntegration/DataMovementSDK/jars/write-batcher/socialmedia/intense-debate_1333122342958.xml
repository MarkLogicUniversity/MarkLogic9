It is Comforting to the pet suffering from Anxiety, and it works for some autistic children as well. Temple Grandin built her own after watching how the cows (she was in veterinary school) seemed to relax after being put in the squeeze chute. A squeeze chute is a box made of heavy metal tubes and the sides are adjustable. When the cow goes into the chute, they are usually agitated because they've been herded into a corral and then chased into the chute. They close the back door of the chute so the cow can't escape and then adjust the sides so the cow is squeezed by tubes. The cow settles down, and they can give vaccinations, dewormers,, or give other veterinary care without anyone getting hurt.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zefie</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/hxgv</id></website><link>http://politicalgates.blogspot.com/2012/03/palling-around-with-radicals-and.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T08:29:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:32:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3k41c</id><link>http://politicalgates.blogspot.com/2012/03/palling-around-with-radicals-and.html#comment-480161091</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a8s1u</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
