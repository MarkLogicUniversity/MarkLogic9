Â And, if a few cities Burned, how would they handle that? Â It would seem to me that there is no way obama could spin this if a few cities Burned, a few hundred people killed. Â So, it must be that they are confident that they can turn the bla cks on and Off like water out of a faucet. Â And, that is why Sharpton and Jackson have their jobs. Â They are essentially the handle on the faucet. Â But all of this is just getting the liberal factions energized. Â The re-election committee is going step-by-step through each of their radical interest groups, creating an incident to get their people up for the election. Â They have been through feminists and bla cks. Next will probably be a homosexual incident.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67pla2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/31/trayvon-martin-funeral-director-no-signs-fight/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:01:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T16:37:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwwvj9</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/31/trayvon-martin-funeral-director-no-signs-fight/#comment-481978214</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h1ijg</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
