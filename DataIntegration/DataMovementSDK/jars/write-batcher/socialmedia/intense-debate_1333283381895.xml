I also submit the romantic leads in the Little Mermaid and Aladdin as examples where the chemistry is seriously lacking, in comparison to Beauty and the Beast, where it would have worked even without the obligatory falling in love songs...

I did not mean to question your commitment to animated storytelling as a respectable art form, but that comment did rub me the wrong way, and I'm not sure that it was just the way you expresed it.

I do, however, greatly appreciate these reviews, and I have been thinking a great deal about Zuko and Swearingen for a couple of days now, and I particularly applaud that unexpected and illuminating comparison.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h7fes</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-western-air-templethe-firebending-masters,71161/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T15:01:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T05:36:00+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwf1ov</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-western-air-templethe-firebending-masters,71161/#comment-481568704</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/d40tb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
