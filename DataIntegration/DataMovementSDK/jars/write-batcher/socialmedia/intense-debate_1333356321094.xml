Â I have also argued from belief on occasion and have enough common sense to realise that if someone is posting on &lt;b&gt;ex-christian&lt;/b&gt; that they are likely to be doing the same as well (unless the person is an apologist whom one can Spot a mile Off). Â Thus, it grinds my gears when I make a comment to that effect but someone then thinks I'm arguing &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; the existence of god or something, thus completely missing the point.

As is the case with your comment above, it's patently obvious that you were being sarcastic. Â We're all on the same team here for the most part; some people need to stop being so sensitive.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/66oqt7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/768</id></website><link>http://new.exchristian.net/2012/03/noahs-ark-revisited.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-24T13:54:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T07:33:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0jvkt</id><link>http://new.exchristian.net/2012/03/noahs-ark-revisited.html#comment-483331373</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5xjbh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
