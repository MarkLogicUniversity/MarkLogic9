If Earth was a few degrees further Off our orbit, we'd freeze or Burn to death. Heck, when i studied in depth on circulatory systems of humans, if certain parts were placed differently they would not work. Personally, i'd rather die believing that i was created by a divine being than die believing i evolved from a hairy flea covered ape.Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6d5wcu</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/d5sf</id></website><link>http://thetimes-tribune.com/colts-stands-firm-on-atheist-ad-1.1288259</link><postedTime>2012-03-20T20:08:02+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-21T18:40:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mpzek1</id><link>http://thetimes-tribune.com/colts-stands-firm-on-atheist-ad-1.1288259#comment-472634196</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gr2mr</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-20</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
