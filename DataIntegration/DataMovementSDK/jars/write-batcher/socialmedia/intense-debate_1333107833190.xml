It really wasnâ€™t even on my radar until just two days ago when I read nearly all the posts on the thread about the Stanford city manager. I went to most to the given links to verify the facts. The more I read the more I became of the opinion that there needs to be further investigations to find the truth because there sure are questions about supposed facts. 
Â 
The forensic evidence will either verify who had what wounds and power Burns. I donâ€™t think the videos weâ€™ve seen on Weblog tell us conclusively if Zimmerman was injured. Thereâ€™s talk about Â â€œthe judgeâ€&#157; Â and if that is relevant to the â€œfactsâ€&#157; it will be exposed in due time if the state does the investigation. 
Â 
If Â the evidence shows Zimmerman may have committed a crime then he should be charged and let him have his day in court. I would suggest a civil suit from the Martins because they are due his day in court as well for the sake of Trevon . Â I doubt it thereâ€™s a lack of support for the civil suit. Â We can hope our justice system can work no matter whoâ€™s at the reins but thereâ€™s  doubt about that Iâ€™m sure. 
Â 
Its a fact the &lt;i&gt;powder keg&lt;/i&gt; issues of racism and gun control is being played into this tragedy. Â Both sides are taking sides as usual and have come to premature conclusions. Now that the media is playing into these election time PK issues I just hope it getâ€™s  soon for the sake of a fair sic election. I have doubts about that. These rush to judgment opinions played out in the media during a Heated election might just might add some more victims to this tragedy not counting Zimmermanâ€™s (even those not related) and the Martins because they already are no matter how the facts
