It will be a huge blow to Granville Island merchants unless what replaces it draws an equivalent number of people to the island as Emily Carr does. Opus Art Supplies will be devasted by this move. Also, there are already several theatres, and artisan shops-anything that replaces it should add something new and interesting for both locals and visitors rather than more of the same. I don't know what that is but hopefully not more of the same. 

I do like the idea of  vehicles (except for merchants and people who have mobility concerns) so the streetcar is a good option. It would be nice to see all those tourist busses that line up in one Spot be moved Off island. It is becoming more difficult to walk around because drivers become impatient and the taxis -sheesh-they lean on the horn every time a pedestrian crosses their path and I have seen several of them yell at tourists for walking in front od them. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ynz7t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rb9b</id></website><link>http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2012/03/emily-carr-move-to-east-vancouver-great-northern-way-campus/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T15:01:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T21:26:50+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mie38q</id><link>http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2012/03/emily-carr-move-to-east-vancouver-great-northern-way-campus/#comment-473974507</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
