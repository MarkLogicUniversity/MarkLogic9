Dear Mr. President,
I am writing to explain why so many Americans are questioning your ideology, motives and intentions.Â  Doing the research on your background has made us seriously doubt whether you embrace Capitalism or America for that matter.Â  The United States has been the envy of the world because of the opportunities we offer and where the poorest of our poor, live better than 90% of the planet.Â  The following is very disturbing.
We realize now that your parents were Communists as well as your stepfather, grandparents who raised you from ages 10 to 18 and mentor, Frank Davis.Â  You have launched your campaign in the home of William Ayers, a Communist terrorist bomber, appointed self proclaimed Communists as unaccountable czars and in other key leadership positions.Â  George Soros, a Communist that has made billions toppling economies, has visited the White house no less than nine times.Â  You also gave a Brazilian oil conglomerate billions of our tax dollars to drill in waters deeper than you allow us to drill.Â  George Soros happens to be a major stockholder in this Brazilian company but, Iâ€™m getting  track.
After reading the writings and teachings of Cloward/Piven and Saul Alinsky, Communist professors, many of us have come to the conclusion that your upbringing and ideology are following their game plan for the destruction of America.Â  They teach us that the best way to destroy America is from within.Â  Infiltrate the government, educational system and the media.Â  Overload the country with entitlement programs until the economy implodes, that is when people will truly be dependent on government.Â  Truth means nothing and the end justifies the means.Â  When you do something wrong, blame your opponent, when they do something right, take credit for it.Â   attack the opposition and never let up.Â  The real power in America is to be obtained through the guilt of the white middle class.Â  Stifle the free market and block any attempts for true independence.Â  The collective is more important than any individual.
The following are just a few examples why many of us do not believe you honor or admire the Constitution or the country our incredibly brilliant founding fathers envisioned.Â  Forgive me for missing some, but I am sure you will understand my reasoning.
1)Â Â Â Â Â  We were promised health care debates on CSPAN.Â  Only to find out the Universal Health care Bill was written in private by lobbyists and we had to vote for it to see what was in it.
2)Â Â Â Â Â  We were promised no lobbyists in your administration and we know how that turned out.
3)Â Â Â Â Â  We were promised unemployment would not go over 8% if we voted for your Stimulus Program.Â  What is even more disturbing are the unemployment numbers you are trying to convince us are accurate.Â  Yet, you donâ€™t include the people who have quit looking for work.Â   on the report you read, brings unemployment closer to 12% to 17%.Â  You also expand government like adding on 17,000 IRS agents and claim it as a victory in fighting unemployment.Â  What you donâ€™t explain is that it takes seven to eight private sector jobs of comparable salaries to pay for one government position.Â  In other words, it would take at least 119,000 private sector jobs of equal salary to pay for the 17,000 IRS agentsâ€™ benefits and wages.Â  At best, your figures are disingenuous.Â  
4)Â Â Â Â Â  We were promised you would open up drilling.Â  Instead you have closed drilling and are blocking a pipeline that will make us less vulnerable to countries that want to destroy our way of life.Â  Not to mention the jobs it would create.Â  You have also been taped as saying you are going to tax the coal companies out of existence.Â  Not to mention the refusal to create clean energy through nuclear power, even though Europe gets 70% of their energy through this technology.Â  Do you really want us to become energy independent and stop sending hundreds of billions of our hard earned dollars to the Middle East and Venezuela?Â  Your actions say otherwise.
5)Â Â Â Â Â  We see companies like GE, who owned NBC and its affiliates, not having to pay taxes on over 60 billion in profits.Â  I wonâ€™t go into how their employees were not allowed to say anything negative about you and how they use Saul Alinsky style tactics to denigrate the opposition.Â  We are also aware of GEâ€™s investment in the Green Agenda and how they stand to profit hundreds of billions through this technology.Â  Donâ€™t you understand that we are seeing the connection?
6)Â Â Â Â Â  We see that for a few hundred thousand dollars in campaign donations will allow your supporters like Solyndra and Range Fuel, to receive hundreds of billions in government loans and subsidies.Â  We do understand the connections and unbridled support of these companies even when your own administration says they are undesirable investments.
7)Â Â Â Â Â  We also see how you have embraced our enemies and insulted our allies.Â  We now know that you were once a Muslim, at least in Indonesia where you attended school, have said the music to attend morning Muslim prayers is the most beautiful sound on earth, how you wrote in your book â€œAudacity of Hopeâ€&#157;Â  â€œI will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.â€&#157;, how you said you visited all 57 states when there are actually 57 Muslim states, your religion was Islam until George Stephanopoulos corrected you and how you attended a church for twenty years that honors the likes of Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader.Â  By the way, we have also found out that the Black Liberation Church you attended was a spinoff of Liberation Theology that the Communists tried to implement in South America during the Che Guevara days.Â  Fortunately, Catholicism was too strong in South America and it didnâ€™t take root.Â  Many of us were also disgusted in how you told Israel how to place their borders. We heard how you told us that in no uncertain terms that we should never invade a country that shows us no imminent threat.Â  Yet, you invade Libya and Uganda without Congressional approval.Â  We are now seeing the Muslim Brotherhood leading these and surrounding nations.Â  Is there a connection here?Â  You do not attend our National Day of Prayer, but attend the Muslim equivalent.Â  Your family does not celebrate Xmas and there have been Christmas ornaments celebrating Chairman Mao and other radicals.Â  Canâ€™t you understand that we are beginning to question your allegiance?Â  
8)Â Â Â Â Â  We have seen relentless attacks of racism on anyone that disagrees with you.Â  May I remind you of a few of your quotes?Â  From Dreams From My Father:

"I ceased to advertise my mother's race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites."Â  "I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race."Â  "There was something about her that made me wary, a little too sure of herself, maybe and white."Â  "It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names."Â  "I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own. It was into my father's image, the black man, son of Africa , that I'd packed all the attributes I sought in myself: the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela."Â  We also see organizations like ACORN and LaRaza that proudlyÂ display Communist posters in their facilities.Â  On a different note, why do we give tax payer funds to an organization that has in their manifesto to take over the Southwest United States?Â Â  Have you ever heard the term â€œGuilt by associationâ€&#157;?Â  We are wondering if it is true.
9)Â Â Â Â Â  We are learning more about or should I say less about your earlier years.Â  Why spend millions hiding your Long Form Birth certificate?Â  Why not bring experts in to circumvent the questions that said birth certificate was photo-shopped?Â  How did you go to Pakistan twice when it was illegal to go there?Â  How did you get a scholarship given only to foreigners?Â  Why canâ€™t we see your passports, student applications, papers, thesis or any documentation relating to your youth and beliefs?Â  Why donâ€™t you clear up the question about your Social Security number coming from Connecticut, a state you have never lived in? Why donâ€™t we know any of your ex-girlfriends, classmates or friends in your college days?Â  Why did you and your wife have to give up your law licenses?Â  The line that it was too expensive to maintain when you are not actually practicing doesnâ€™t really work.Â  Many believe answers to these questions will enhance your chances of reelection.
10)Â Â  We have seen so many of your appointees and associates lie and break the law with no consequence.Â  For example Eric Holder, Rangle, Geitner, Dodd, Frank, just to name a few.Â  After six months in office you fired Inspector General for Americorps, Gerald Walpin, immediately once he discovered that a major backer of yours, Kevin Johnson, was found illegally using taxpayer funds.Â  The irony of the firing is that you cosponsored a bill that made it illegal to fire an Inspector General for at least thirty days.Â  We see convicted Black Panthers released without them even requesting the dismissal of charges.Â  We see you immediately say that a white officer was racist when he detained a black Professor friend of yours.Â  We see that Eric Holder was bragging about implementing â€œOperation Gunrunnerâ€&#157; in 2009, but claims he knew nothing about â€œFast and Furiousâ€&#157;, which is virtually the same program.Â  Now some government employees are pleading the fifth so they will not incriminate themselves or others.Â  These are government employees pleading the fifth?Â  That is insane.Â  Many of us are curious if those pleading the fifth will be promoted.
11)Â Â  The Cap and Trade bill was initially passed without anyone being able to read it.Â  What happened to your promise that bills would be on the internet for two weeks before a vote?Â  Please clear something up for me regarding Cap and Trade.Â  Iâ€™m not here to argue if man influences climate change, I will leave that for the experts to debate, if the debate is ever allowed.Â  What bothers me is that the bill would tax us a trillion a year so, according to your Secretary of Energy Chu, who wants Americans to spend $8 a gallon for gas, would cause Americans to use less fossil fuel.Â  The irony is that none of the tax money collected would go to cleaning up pollution or helping our infrastructure or paying down our debt.Â  The money is earmarked for third world countries.Â  Spreading the wealth around is a Communist philosophy, not Capitalist.Â  Capitalist spread their wealth around by being charitable and not with funds they can't afford to spend.
12)Â  Where is your budget?Â  You want us to believe you on economic issues, but you have never submitted a budget which is required.Â  Hard to believe somebody about the wonderful things they are doing when they havenâ€™t showed us the basic instrument to gauge their plans on.Â  Does this make sense to you Sir?Â  You did submit one budget that was voted down 0 to 97.Â  Then you quit submitting yearly budgets and chastise Republicans for theirs.Â  It is hard to give you any credibility for your comments about budgets.
Mr. President, there are so many other questions I could bring up.Â  But, we are seeing a trend that rings a resounding anti-American belief.Â  Without going into detail, here are just a few.Â Â  The unconstitutional defense bill that was just passed (when you rallied against the Patriot Act), Cash For Clunkers, car dealerships closed that were overwhelmingly supporters of Republicans, travel expenses for you and your family, tax cheats freed, insider trading condoned, EPA controlling and stifling business, your planned domestic army that will rival our military, campaign speeches at Caterpillar and other companies (then they open plants in China), lack of access by reporters who do not support you, refusing help from nineteen nations to clean up the Gulf Oil Spill, stopping Kevin Costnerâ€™s company from cleaning up oil due to some stupid permitting reasons (I liken it to not letting a neighbor throw a bucket of water on your Burning child because he is not a trained fire fighter) clearing the swamp of corruption, why Michelle needs seven times more assistants than any First Lady in history, where is the 1.2 billion Corzine canâ€™t find, why your illegal relatives are still in this country getting aid that is meant for Americans, why you will not let states enforce our immigration laws, why you refuse to acknowledge Islamist terrorists for what they are (even when they yell Allah Akbar while they are killing people), what future do you see for Israel, why the US Geological report says the United States has more oil than the Middle East combined and we can get it for $16 a barrel (why not use our own) and what are you really trying to accomplish? 
Â I love this country and respect the position of President more than you can possibly understand.Â  If called upon, I would lay down my life for this country that so many have done before me.Â  Please take this opportunity and set the record straight.Â  I hope you understand that I am not alone in my statements and it would benefit you and your future chances of reelection if addressed.Â  More to the point, we are owed some answers.
Sincerely,
Edward L.
