Two of my step sisters (who are feminist challenged) think that Albertan strip clubs are not exploitive whatsoever.  Never mind the fact that all of them, according to some good Police friends, are run by gangs.  Never mind that many of the women are foreign workers under the Canadian governments bogus work programs that are akin to slavery and make next to nothing.  

Their favorite story is about how guys will Heat up their toonies first before trying to hit them in the crotch.  

I love naked people, but strip clubs are where I draw the line. I think there will Always be a hugely exploitive nature to them. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r3iz0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tdqu</id></website><link>http://www.xojane.com/sex/why-im-not-strip-club-dude</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:37:04+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:09:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkfal4</id><link>http://www.xojane.com/sex/why-im-not-strip-club-dude#comment-476499474</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/li49o</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
