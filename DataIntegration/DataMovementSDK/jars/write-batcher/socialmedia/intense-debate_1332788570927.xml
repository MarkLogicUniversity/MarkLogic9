I stick to my original post, the average  life is the same as the  2, the Heat is not noticeable in the real world, the size different is not noticeable in the real world. The article is written to be sensational and get hit.  Additionally, the screen is incredible, the speed great, the software fantastic, the touch screen super responsive.  This is classic FUD, you put fear and doubt in people mind, you mention nothing positive.

This paragraph is proof â€”  "My initial guess was that fault lay with the Apple A5X CPU and the PowerVR SGX 543MP4 quad-core GPU needed to render all those new pixels, but the culprit seems to be primarily the backlight. And since no one's conducted 3D gaming  tests yet, it remains to be seen how much worse things can get."  You are calling a device that gets better Battery life than anything else on the market with a screen that is multiple times better than anything on the market and say "how much worse things can get".   How much worse than what?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6dsyg4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4v3h</id></website><link>http://www.informationweek.com/byte/news/personal-tech/tablets/232602960</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T16:46:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-21T22:57:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mpqub7</id><link>http://www.informationweek.com/byte/news/personal-tech/tablets/232602960#comment-472889175</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zmqmk</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
