I've been trying forever to find a good combination of therapy and meds to help me.Â  Having a supportive partner has Always helped me more than anything else.

Hopefully my story will go like yours soon and I'll find a good therapist and good plan of action and start doing a whole hell of a lot better.Â  Thanks for giving me hope &lt;3</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/66ul2n</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/772v</id></website><link>http://webcomics.yaoi911.com/archive/artifice-page-87/</link><postedTime>2012-03-24T07:02:13+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T06:20:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw954f</id><link>http://webcomics.yaoi911.com/archive/artifice-page-87/#comment-481589089</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g4cxv</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
