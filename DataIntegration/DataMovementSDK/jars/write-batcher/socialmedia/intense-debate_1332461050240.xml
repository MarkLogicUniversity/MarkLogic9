Long is very sweet. When I had a girlfriend, I just took all the cards and cash out of her wallet so she couldn't pay. Then I paid. I dont remember what it was though... erased the bad memories out of my head pretty much haha. 

You wrote when march started that you were stressed? I hope you are no longer? Life is great what's there to stress too much about. Work stuff is  a Headache, I just leave that at work and don't even think about it. People are stupid and rude... lots of rudeness toward the turtle lately.

PS - I just wanted to thank you for that massive long comment you left me when I typed my random things out. That was the best one and I read it two or three times because it was funny! You... are probably one of my longest and bestest blog readers ever~ From the day we talked to each other on soompi to now... you Always leave really nice comments for me.
