This is so similar to what happened to me.
I lost my Daddy to lung cancer about an hour before Father's Day in 2010 (I was in 7th grade. I'm in 9th grade now.)... I cried myself to sleep when my mom got that call... I started cutting... Cussing at my mom and grandparents... Tuning out at school...I have developed anger issues, OCD, and depression. I have to take medication now, but it makes me nauseous and gives me Headaches...
I haven't lived with my Daddy since I was 2... I didn't see him often until he got lung cancer (which he had for 2 years). I just keep remembering the one argument we ever had... I told him I hated him... I was about 7 when that happened. I'm almost 15 now. I'm just Glad I had the chance to talk to him and tell him I love him...but I regret that I didn't see him more often, tell him I love him more, or live with him...
Please, keep me in your prayers... I really need them :/ I'll be praying for you, also.
You're story helped me, it really did. I don't know why, though...Maybe because I saw that I'm not alone.
God bless you.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/c050b1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/znjq</id></website><link>http://us.reachout.com/real-stories/story/wheres-daddy</link><postedTime>2011-02-26T01:39:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T01:34:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mktnbs</id><link>http://us.reachout.com/real-stories/story/wheres-daddy#comment-476151224</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-02-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
