No "grabbing at straws."
He's Spot on.
He was talking about the jury, not the laws. And Both Zimmerman AND Goetz were armed vigilantes. Big SIMILARITY.
This case is ALSO similar to a case in Texas, involving a guy witnessing his NEIGHBORS house being burguled. He told the 911 dispatcher that he was going to go confront them, the 911 operator told him not to, he said, "these A$$holes  get away," then he went after them as they were running away with a tv and shot the two of them dead - even after they dropped the tv. Two dead Mexicans. One rescued television. Killer  Scott-free.

It wasn't even HIS HOUSE.

I'll bet Zimmernan had heard of this case.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hw3if</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/vr8i</id></website><link>http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/videos/like-bernie-goetz-if-zimmerman-can-prove-reasonable-fear-of-black-men-he-could-be-acquitted</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T01:21:42+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:02:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwqkns</id><link>http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/videos/like-bernie-goetz-if-zimmerman-can-prove-reasonable-fear-of-black-men-he-could-be-acquitted#comment-481297568</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/mnkv5</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
