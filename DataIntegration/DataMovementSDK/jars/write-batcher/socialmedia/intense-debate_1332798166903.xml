Aquion Energy - sodium-ion ("salt water") . 

Inexpensive materials.  Activated carbon anode and a sodium- and manganese-based cathode.  

Operate at room temperature.  No self discharge or problems in high Heat conditions.

Can be 100% discharged without damage.

High tolerance to  mismatch.

100% recyclable.

Third party testing &gt;5,000 cycles rapid charges with no degrading.  Company expects 20,000 cycles when fully developed.

Tested for two calendar years so far with no loss of performance.

Expected price around $300/kW.

@5,000 cycles = $0.06/kWh,  @10,000 cycles = $0.03/kWh, @20,000 cycles = $0.015/kWh.

(Back of envelop calculations)
$0.05/kWh Wind + $0.03/kWh Storage + Overhead + 15% Loss (85% Efficient) =~ $0.10/kWh Stored Wind.  

Solar is expected to fall to close to $0.06/kWh.  

That makes a combination of wind, solar and stored wind/solar cheaper than new nuclear or new coal.  (Or old coal if you add in externalities.)  Certainly cheaper than natural gas peaking plants.

Lighter weight than lead acid Batteries - cheaper shipping.

Going into production.  Currently setting up factory in Pennsylvania.  Expect to be manufacturing in 2013.

Now, if the MIT solution is even better, that's a good thing....</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/yu6td4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/68bl</id></website><link>http://cleantechnica.com/2012/02/20/mit-liquid-batteries-for-utilities-could-make-renewables-competitive-and-it-is-not-lithium-ion/</link><postedTime>2012-02-20T20:17:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T20:23:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkpxrn</id><link>http://cleantechnica.com/2012/02/20/mit-liquid-batteries-for-utilities-could-make-renewables-competitive-and-it-is-not-lithium-ion/#comment-476711984</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cctpv</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-02-20</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
