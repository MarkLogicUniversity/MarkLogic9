But regarding religion, and someone correct me if I'm wrong, here's the runthrough as best I can figure. There's the "old gods" who reside in trees and are worshipped in the north.

Then there's the "seven" who are worshipped in the rest of the kingdoms and were the ones being Burnt by Red-head.Â  I assume the seven have names and personalities, but I don't know them.

Then there's, what, the Lord of Light, who Red is introducing, right?Â  Although she seems to have some legitimacy, as she spoke of the dead walking in the north.Â  And fire is the only thing that can kill said walking dead.Â  And she speaks of fire cleansing the world, hmm...

I'm sure the wildlings and Dothraki each have their own sets of gods as well.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vke75</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-north-remembers-for-newbies,71348/</link><postedTime>2012-04-02T02:07:05+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T05:52:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m09sww</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-north-remembers-for-newbies,71348/#comment-483305578</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6ai89</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
