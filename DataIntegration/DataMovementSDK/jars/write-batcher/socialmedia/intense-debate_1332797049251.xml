Furthermore, certified neighborhood watch members are not permitted to carry any weapons whatsoever, not even a large flashlight.Â Â  This lunatic was a self-appointed vigilante who defied the dispatcher who informed him he didn't need to be following Trayvon.Â Â  But no, "they" Always get away, so he was bound and determined to not let that happen this time.Â Â  

I say, too bad Trayvon didn't kill the sonofabitch before he was shot to death in Cold blood by a self appointed "coon hunter" based on his epithet of choice and his actions.Â Â Â  

This is like the sherriff's office collaborating with the Klan to set lynchers free in the Jim Crow south.Â Â Â Â  Mississippi Burning redux in Sanford, Florida.

So they can take that Florida paper and wipe their asses with it.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r3urv</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/cusm</id></website><link>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/03/26/zimmermans-friend-no-trial-by-jury-is-need-for-martin-shooting/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:27:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:27:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mko4re</id><link>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/03/26/zimmermans-friend-no-trial-by-jury-is-need-for-martin-shooting/#comment-476661426</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8yj3t</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
