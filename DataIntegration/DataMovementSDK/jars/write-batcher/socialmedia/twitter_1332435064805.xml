Zimmerman said the kid "looked black" in response to the 911 operator asking him what color the kid was, f**king c**ns or f**cking punks? Â An expert brought in by a local TV station says it was the latter. Â If taking things out of context is the only way you can make a case, you have no case at all.Hispanics can be white, indeed, but it seems that this is the only kind of situation they ever get lumped in with the white community, when the race-baiters have something to . Â Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson play this game to keep everyone from realizing how irrelevant they are.The only racial elements to this case are fabricated by those that want to see them. Â This young man's death was a senseless tragedy perpetrated by a wanna-be hero who was just Itching to be the savior of the community, nothing more...nothing less.
