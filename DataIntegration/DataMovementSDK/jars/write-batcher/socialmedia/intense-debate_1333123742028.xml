We requested to interview him for the Defensive Coordinator Spot last year, and finally landed him as DB coach this year. The organization obviously values his opinion. I truly doubt they're ushering him into Philly with a greeting of, "Hey, we're gonna go trade our top-playmaking DB for peanuts. Suck it!" You've got to think that Bowles has signed Off on this. He likes his press corners as much as anyone, judging by the likes of Vontae Davis, Sean Smith, and Nolan Carroll gobbling up playing time in Miami the past few years.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zn1qg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xiyd</id></website><link>http://igglesblitz.com/philadelphia-eagles-2/asante-donovan-and-drc/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:44:04+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:35:46+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3stb3</id><link>http://igglesblitz.com/philadelphia-eagles-2/asante-donovan-and-drc/#comment-480206409</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/yn4zc</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
