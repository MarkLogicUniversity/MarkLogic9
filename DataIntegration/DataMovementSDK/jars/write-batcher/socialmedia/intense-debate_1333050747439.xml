I love my new  there's a couple of issues I have with it. Firstly my  drains really fast. Like from 100% to dead in 4hrs, &amp; sometimes in just 3hrs (even with Bluetooth &amp; location services turned  &amp; a minimal number of apps running). Secondly it's taking my  as long as 7-8hrs to charge from say 5% to 100%. It takes my iPhone 4 less than an hour to charge from dead to 100%.... Plus the Heat thing is a real issue. If I leave mine running for an hour or more it gets so hot sometimes, it's Too hot to have resting on my bare skin as it feels like it might Burn me.... I still love my Ipad but these little issues are annoying!!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lpnys</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5hi1</id></website><link>http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/03/apple-no-battery-issues-with-new-ipad-in-fact-your-concerns-are-actually-a-feature/</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T19:06:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:12:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3vkcu</id><link>http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/03/apple-no-battery-issues-with-new-ipad-in-fact-your-concerns-are-actually-a-feature/#comment-479477363</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
