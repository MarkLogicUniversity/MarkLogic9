I hadn't appreciated that  after tea and dinner one wasn't supposed to fit in supper as well.

It's really much better if with holidays in the US, because they eat at strange hours.  Get up early and fit in a small  breakfast at 5 am, then a larger one at say 9.30 ( 2 eggs over easy, 3 links, 3 strips, hash browns and a short stack, OJ and coffee or corned beef hash and 3 eggs - yum).Little somethings mid-morning - say a donut and coffee - lunch  at 12, the odd ice-cream or Cold drink slotted in,  little somethings mid-afternoon, dinner early - say 5.30-6 - then a snackeroo mid evening. OK, this cuts down the time available for sightseeing but hey, it's important to keep up your strength when in foreign parts, no?And of course there are  the candy bars and potato chips kept in the car to stave Off starvation.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zn5tg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/9173644/The-class-war-is-still-raging-across-the-dining-table.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:19:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:42:50+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m33t5p</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/9173644/The-class-war-is-still-raging-across-the-dining-table.html#comment-480252413</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8x0h0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
