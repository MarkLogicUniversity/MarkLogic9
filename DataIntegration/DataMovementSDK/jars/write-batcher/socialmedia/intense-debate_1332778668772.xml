-Martin wanted skittles and tea
-Martin didn't want to walk "all the way around" the gated comm. to get to the store
-Martin did like most teen guys do, and "cut through" an area he didn't belong
-Zimm Spots black youth cutting behind houses
-Zimm knows that black youths have been accused of thefts in the area
-Zimm wants to do a 'good job' and have this kid questioned
-Martin runs because #1 it's fun..#2 he doesn't want ANY blights on his record that might affect his football playing
-Zimm thinks to himself..."oh sh*&amp;, this kid is running, he must be guilty....I might help catch 1 of these bad kids and do the comm. a favor"
-Zimm catches up with Martin; the chase pumps up his endorphins and causes him to be overzealous
-Martin proceeds to beat the snot out of Zimm
-Zimm is now 100% convinced this kid is worse than he actually is
-Zimm shoots the kid


If i'm the Judge...I call 'Manslaughter'...and sentence him appropriatelyÂ 


End Reasoning.....Zimm shouldn't have inflamed the situation...and Martin shouldn't have beat him so badly that Zimm felt the need to shoot....Both could have taken other action to De-Escalate the situation, and neither did....""With great power comes great responsibility"", Martin had great power over Zimm and failed to back Off...Zimm had great power and used it in a reckless manner..(albeit under good intentions)...Hence---&gt; Manslaughter Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rftm0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T06:36:28+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:44:43+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk1usd</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-476482040</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/avyfh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
