OBAMA LIES, COAL AND OIL DIES.

This  P O S  k i l l s  oil exploration and drilling Off the Atlantic coast for another FIVE years, Americans are Bleeding at the pumps AS A DIRECT RESULT OF HIS INSANE ATTACKS on coal and oil for the past three years and three months.

Obama is a SOCIOPATH, this is not disputed by any of his advisers or his supporters.

Now, I am genuinely concerned about his mental stability, and I am starting to see parallels between his actions, and the actions of  A dolph  H itler in the waning days of his grasp on the reigns of power in Germany.

When  H itler felt the German people had betrayed him, that they no longer loved him or believed in him, he turned his wrath on the German people with a "scorched" earth policy.

I feel that this is what Obama has planned for America.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67pjdz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/03/31/obama-calls-on-congress-to-increase-taxes-on-millionaires/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:26:52+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:52:21+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwsnlf</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/03/31/obama-calls-on-congress-to-increase-taxes-on-millionaires/#comment-481889545</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8k4e0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
