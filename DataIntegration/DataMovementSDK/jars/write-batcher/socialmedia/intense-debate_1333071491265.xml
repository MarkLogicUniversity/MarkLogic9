Position players: Teagarden probably starts either on DL or at rehab assignment or extended spring training, So Weiters and Paulino come north, Outfielders Miller released he really has not had a very good spring even when he wasn't dealing with an injury,   Then it comes down to Betemit and Johnson as to who you bring north.  I would probably say Betemit.  Then one more Spot needs to be taken care of and that would be a tough decision.   </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z6e51</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/z6fr</id></website><link>http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2012/03/sarasota-fla---the-orioles.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T11:41:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:08:33+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3xpj5</id><link>http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2012/03/sarasota-fla---the-orioles.html#comment-479708896</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hzph0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
