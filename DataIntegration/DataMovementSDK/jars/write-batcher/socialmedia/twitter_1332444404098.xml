In keeping with your analogy, I'd say you think so. But also, what do we really do about Iran? Do we invade a country that is over twice the size of Iraq and pry the weapon from their Cold dead hand? This when we currently have troops committed to Afghanistan? Can we really afford this being 15 trillion in debt? Or are we going to impose sanctions on Iran? These really never work and wind up hurting the people of these nations rather than their government (our real target). You can Shout all you want that we need to do something about Iran, or other nations you think are threats. But what affective means do we really use to deal with those nations? Maybe invasion, sanctions, occupation and nation building aren't the answer after all.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ydinl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/egg0</id></website><link>http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/03/22/ron_paul_keeps_on_truckin_but_to_what_end__113553-comments.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T03:58:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T18:36:40+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/micpv7</id><link>http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/03/22/ron_paul_keeps_on_truckin_but_to_what_end__113553-comments.html#comment-473829855</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/54at1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
