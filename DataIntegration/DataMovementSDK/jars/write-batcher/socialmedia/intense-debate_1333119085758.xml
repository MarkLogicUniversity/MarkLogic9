Santorum in a live interview tonight on EWTN. He still believes a divine intervention could vault him onto the GOP ticket and into the White House.

The EWTN interviewer played the clip with Rick  bull**** (bleeped out) but did not  disgusted at this filthy language coming from a Catholic in the public eye. Rick answered the question about the incident but did not apologize to Catholics for setting a bad example. It was a softball PR appearance and Rick was treated like a rock star.

In the 15 minute interview, he did not smile in his usual way. He looked worried and his frown was down. Makes him look a lot older and more serious. His handlers must have told him his childish goofy grin persona was turning Off the voters. He smiled only once, at the very end of the lengthy interview. Â Then again, maybe it was Constipation.

He was asked about Iran and he said that even though there is no proof they are building a weapon, that he, Rick Santorum, has no problem with Israel launching a pre-emptive strike, and as president he would support Israel come hell or high water, so to speak.Â 

Either he's in denial about the Romney endorsements or enraptured by a heavenly power trip.
Just keeps oozing out.
