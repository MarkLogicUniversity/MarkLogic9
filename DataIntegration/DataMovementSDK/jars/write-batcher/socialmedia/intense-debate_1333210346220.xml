This appeared in the NY Times the day after the Raid that killed Bin Laden.  US agents have since been trying to pry out of her the names of the 'doctors who treated' him, as if this were an impossibility.  They overlook that watermelon is a well-known diuretic (eat a half a melon to see for yourself) and has long been used for over Heated kidneys with poor renal secretion.  US agents have the same prejudices of US doctors; they don't believe folk remedies can have any power.
