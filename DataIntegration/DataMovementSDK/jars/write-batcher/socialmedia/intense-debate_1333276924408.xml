First  once you have children it's the mother's place to raise her child.. If Kim did not know how to handle a baby she should have not had anymore after her first daughter.. Kim is lazy &amp; a Cry baby.. Kim needs to grow up &amp; get Off her lazy ass.. Kim is to dependable on others instead of being independent..
