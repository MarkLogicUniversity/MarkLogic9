I just have to say a quick couple of words.....there\'s something so cool about missioning along the coast and arriving at a local -Spot \"car-park\".......some guys you can Spot peeing against their wheels, marking territory whilst others welcome you with a look of acceptance.....others don\'t even realise you arrived and others have been there the whole day - hogging the parking space and using it as a social office.....with words like â€œ you should have been yesterday bruâ€™ . 
i\'m a surfers wife (and love playing in the waves myself) and my heart beats fast when i just think about a  mission along the coast, stopping at garbage dumps..who else heads for the dune? The mission to Heaven knowing that when you head that way its for one reason onlyâ€¦or even the feeling when you drive up and down and then think what the hell lets head to Yzers thereâ€™s gotta be something there......arriving at Bettie\'s and that feeling that you have when you arrive in that car-park checking out the cars and start counting how many with roof racks and no boards...or roof racks and boards still on the roof...and then running along the path over the dune and that feeling you get when you check it cooking.....when you wake up as early as you can and what a surprise when you find another car there....with a chilled dude in his pajama pants with his little daughter on his hip doing  check so that mom can have a sleep in...... with the tunes out of his car setting the scene and a Dalmatian dog running about.....oooohhh...and who remembers the old days at E -bay...when we still parked on the beach (...miss it! but Glad they changed that..).. braaiing a worsie or having a NikNaks chip roll - sommer net daar in the \"car-park\"....everyone there for the same reason and sharing in the vibe of \"oneness\"....hiehie until you get in the water :-)...  BUT  i guess there is nothing like the feeling when you arrive at a car-park like Farmers and realise ...everyone\'s crowding the point to lazy to make a mission as what they see is good enough.... and you gonna have it to yourself !!!!!!!.....that to me is the ultimate surfer-car-park-experience................... </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:316906:127022926</id><idPostId>127022926</idPostId><idBlogId>316906</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:316906</id><idBlogId>316906</idBlogId><link>http://swg.co.za/zagcms</link><displayName>Zigzag Magazine</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://swg.co.za/zagcms/carparks/</link><displayName>Carparks...</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2010-10-15T12:29:46.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:316906:127022926:321902726</id><link>http://swg.co.za/zagcms/carparks/#IDComment321902726</link><postedTime>2010-10-15T12:29:46.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Carparks... by Champoo</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link/><idEmailMd5>f00de555576c326dc49221f0bdfad0e5</idEmailMd5><displayName>Champoo</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>Champoo commented on &lt;a href="http://swg.co.za/zagcms/carparks/"&gt;Carparks...&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2010-10-15</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
