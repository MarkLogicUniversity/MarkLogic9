the country dry. For all that this Company has gotten from Jamaica,
how much have they given back? This is one hotel that has Always done well despite the negative circumstances in Jamaica, it is said that even at the worst periods in Jamaica it hardly fell below 85% occupancy. I hope that the Country will benefit somehow from whatever is taking place or is in the pipe line. It does seem an odd time to be closing.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zkizf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/8kz5</id></website><link>http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120330/lead/lead91.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T06:06:28+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T04:05:22+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw14ap</id><link>http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120330/lead/lead91.html#comment-481513313</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
