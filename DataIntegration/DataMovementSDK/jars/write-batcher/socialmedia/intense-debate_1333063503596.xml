Even if u dont have Name Brand clothes. I am Glad to hear that the students that fall into gay/lesbian have people they can go to if they need to talk. Their are so many people that are against gay/lesbian rights that its affecting what our children think. I have friends that are gay and lesbian and i love them just like i would love any friend that isnt. They are people like everyone else, they Bleed like we do, their heart beats like ours, and most of all they have the same feelings we do. So the next time u want to say anything negative against the Gay and lesbians think how u would feel if someone was trying to take rights away from you or picking on you because u were different. I personally like what this teacher did at this school.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hs9qw</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dngw</id></website><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/28/news/gay-tolerance-t-shirt-on-brunswick-classroom-wall-triggers-wider-conversation/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T22:59:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:41:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3qdos</id><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/28/news/gay-tolerance-t-shirt-on-brunswick-classroom-wall-triggers-wider-conversation/#comment-479588432</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzeqq</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
