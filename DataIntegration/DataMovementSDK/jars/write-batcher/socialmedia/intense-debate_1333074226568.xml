Moreover, feelingsÂ such as anger, boredom or Anxiety are rare, mostly itâ€™s just a plain unadulterated desire to reward/make myself happy with food. For me, food quiets the inner critic, who is  asking me to be more and do more.Â  My eating â€œdelinquencyâ€&#157; allows me to tell that inner critic to go take a hike.Â  My inner voice is Always telling me to do better than what Iâ€™m currently doing, so the idea of taking a walk instead of eating is exactly the type of behaviour Iâ€™m trying to escape.

Thanks for the opportunity to feel understood and having to articulate my feelings really helped me to understand them.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rqle9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/h6p7</id></website><link>http://www.shrinkyourself.com/blog/3_25_2012/Three_Steps_to_Managing_Your_Emotions.asp?bhcp=1</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T22:27:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:45:10+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3b160</id><link>http://www.shrinkyourself.com/blog/3_25_2012/Three_Steps_to_Managing_Your_Emotions.asp?bhcp=1#comment-479748491</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
