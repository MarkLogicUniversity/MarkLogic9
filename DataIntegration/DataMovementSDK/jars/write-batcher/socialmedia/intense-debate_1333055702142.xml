How does someone Burning themselves have any effect on a repressive regime?

If they kill you, there is a chance that you can become a martyr for a cause. But if you kill yourself, even in an over the top manner as this, you're just a crazy person and the movement or cause just has one less person who is willing to do something.

When I see someone setting themselves on fire in protest I see a person who believes that nothing more can be done and has given up. So if that person thinks that the cause is lost why should I, as someone who hasn't been affected, do anything about it. Maybe it's just me but suicides Always scream of despair caused by a loosing battle (be it with a repressive regime, occupation or life itself).
