Basically I think this is a big mess, because people are trying to consider it a "rigorous" scientific explanation to obesity/fat storage, when it is nothing more than an obvious observation and logical fact [some people binge; calories "matter"], which can play a part in a treatment plan.  I've previously made the comparison to smoking addiction and lung cancer.    

...So candy is rewarding, but if you eat only candy, it becomes "boring."  I personally haven't eaten "junk food" in several months, but I can look at a pint of Haagen Daz and remember the goodness.  Are its rewarding properties still lingering from a year ago?  That seems unlikely, so it's the taste...but I thought palatability and reward could be disconnected?  Why do babies Gain weight if they eat such a boring diet?  Why don't lab rats get leaner and leaner since their diets stay the same?

...All of these "holes" can be easily explained by someone with a good understanding of physiology.  But to explain things with physiological mechanisms would imply food reward hypothesis inadequacy.  I think that's why we see terms like "reward system," "palatable," "hedonic," etc, instead of terms like "dopamine release."  The only arguments that involve physiology are deceptive strawmen about insulin.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/675825</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zamt</id></website><link>http://praguestepchild.blogspot.com/2012/03/hyperpalatable-or-hypersalient.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:16:03+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T15:05:51+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwywd1</id><link>http://praguestepchild.blogspot.com/2012/03/hyperpalatable-or-hypersalient.html#comment-480834456</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/e4h8y</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
