First you
were not there so to question what he was wearing or if he was speeding is not
right. This article does not tell you that the Spot where the camry was coming
out of had a major blind Spot and driver's should not be allowed to turn left
(eastbound). I am not defending either parties. "sv650_ryder" so you
know he was wearing the appropriate gear or at least more than others. When I
came on the scene and assisted the other person to start CPR it appeared to me
that Byron had died on contact or very soon thereafter because of the way he
was ejected Off of his bike. 


This was an
uncalled for accident that could have been avoided provided that the lighting
in that area was improved. 


My
condolences go out to the family. It did not appear as though he suffered in
any way. I am sure he was a great person and I would have liked to be able to
see him through to a happier outcome.
