He was  sucking up to people in  which was well know then. He s  struck me as an arrogant douchebag because he Always thought he was in w the elite. Can someone remind him that it was a fellow gurl that helped tackle the mothers on the Sep 11 flight that crashed in PA. But yet, it s only valid when Tom cruise saves a life, that flight hero is Burning in the 7th circle of hell because he liked cock. How silly these breeders think, that man is in heaven because he sacrificed his life for those that the plane was after. Fuck you Carson, Kirk , and all you other small minded fuck heads because you try to cast such a nasty eternity on us. Remember boys, we are faries, and fairies only exist in heaven. And there ya go. Sorry for the long paragraph, but this shit hits home.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zzq3l</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/r5ro</id></website><link>http://manhuntdaily.com/2012/03/i-honestly-thought-carson-daly-was-gay/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:14:03+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:21:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3bc3h</id><link>http://manhuntdaily.com/2012/03/i-honestly-thought-carson-daly-was-gay/#comment-479722081</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
