I'm so  Barney is there to fill that Spot. He's my new favorite for basically all the same reasons. I think he has heart &amp; he doesn't just rely on his god-given talent Â to carry him. He works hard, he's aggressive &amp; his head is Always in the game. When he does make mistakes it's usually because he's being too aggressive. Since everybody makes mistakes, it's easy for me to forgive someone that's trying too hard as opposed to someone that is just being lazy.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zfrml</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27739098%26vkey=news_chc%26c_id=chc</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:32:28+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:20:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwl3gz</id><link>http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27739098%26vkey=news_chc%26c_id=chc#comment-480973010</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c0tdj</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
