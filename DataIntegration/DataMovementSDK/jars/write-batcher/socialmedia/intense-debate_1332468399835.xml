Buy several cans of wasp &amp; hornet spray and keep them handy where you can Reach them and the kids can't.Â  It is worse than pepper spray and will keep on Burning the eyes until an antidote is administered. Also it sprays about 9 feet so you don't have to get up close. I have a can of bear spray. I got it online. We live in the boonies and actually do have bears and the occasional wolf on our property but it would suffice for a meaner animal as well. If you feel the need get a gun and take the training. I am armed and I am under no threat.Â  Keep your car keys on your bedside table and hit the panic button if you feel threatened. Keep your cell phone with you as well. Stay safe and know you are doing the right thing.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ykzur</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/m17z</id></website><link>http://badbreeders.net/2012/03/22/we-get-letters-a-life-changed/</link><postedTime>2012-03-23T00:23:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T00:40:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miyqgw</id><link>http://badbreeders.net/2012/03/22/we-get-letters-a-life-changed/#comment-474096454</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-23</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
