Why single Out aÂ player Petry out of the Whole team that play to Renneys Playbook for the Night. You claim that he has been playing Great then you Slice him down. Your a terrible writer that also has a bad Day like this Column. Many players on the Oilers have bad Games every game and you DON'T single them Out. The Playbook for last night was to make the game Interesting while LOSING the game. As you being a Sports writer You of all people should Know that the Draft pick is the only thing left to play for. Hello. You seem to be getting all caught up on reading all of the Cry babies comments on these pages and going along with them. Your a Better Writer than that. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z8l0j</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7maa</id></website><link>http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/03/29/off-game-for-oilers-petry</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T04:58:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:33:21+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m34aoh</id><link>http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/03/29/off-game-for-oilers-petry#comment-479532685</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zlrri</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
