For now this is a Bleeding story; "when it Bleeds, it leads".Â  Let's look at both sides of the argument.
Â 
If news media want to be fair, how about investigating the flip side of the story?Â  Kids need to know how to really be able to read and critique people without being told they have to accept certain views.Â  The teachers/parents can teach the kids how to present their views, but our kids do not Always think the way we do.Â  If you don't have teenagers, you will find that out when your child becomes one.Â  I am speaking from experience.Â  Be blessed my Christian friend.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yqklx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/03/22/virginia-middle-school-teacher-makes-students-search-for-weaknesses-in-gop/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T14:36:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T20:42:40+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/migwsa</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/03/22/virginia-middle-school-teacher-makes-students-search-for-weaknesses-in-gop/#comment-473930209</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/grdlr</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
