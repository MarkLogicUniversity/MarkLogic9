How can Zimmerman be allowed to claim self defense when he followed that Martin kid?And most of all how is it that Zimmerman has a pistol carry permit/was in possession of a firearm when Zimmerman has convictions for assault on a police officer and for domestic violence?You people go all crazy and Off the wall calling for good laws to be repealed instead of insisting that the news media stick to the facts and holding the news media accountable when the news media lies to us in spite of the facts and that's why we keep losing more and more of our civil rights as a result.When in the hell are you people going to wake up to reality and stop letting the media think and make decisions for you?There was a time when the news media valued and safe guarded the public trust that we American bestowed upon the news media but those days are long gone because the news media now only cares about the "bottom-line" and influencing government policy to favor their stock holders and those that they're beholden to.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zwn3a</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/d53t</id></website><link>http://newsitem.com/opinion/editorials/sound-off/sound-off-03-30-12-1.1292614</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T08:14:00+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T11:39:47+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwg390</id><link>http://newsitem.com/opinion/editorials/sound-off/sound-off-03-30-12-1.1292614#comment-480647195</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5zj9w</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
