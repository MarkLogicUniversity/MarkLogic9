Mitch can play all 3 outfield positions AND catcher...and probably a couple of the infield Spots in a pinch. he has decent speed and a decent bat Off the bench...he's not a defensive liability at his position (outfield).

Pena is a free wheeling, big loopy swinging, grinning from ear to ear, just happy to be here, below average defensive catcher.

The two have nothing in common on the field, and their value to the club could not be more different.

Maier is ok with his role because the players who start in front of him are markedly better than he is...he understands that and does his job with little or no back talk. 

Pena is essentially the backup because KC just simply doesn't have a better option than him...and going out to get someone who might be a smidge better would likely cost them a truckload of money on a veteran catcher on his way out.

I'd take a couple of more Maiers and one less Pena...</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l3srw</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmb</id></website><link>http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/27/3517957/pena-has-no-gripes-at-being-passed.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T22:33:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:48:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw8447</id><link>http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/27/3517957/pena-has-no-gripes-at-being-passed.html#comment-480487479</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zhk4b</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
