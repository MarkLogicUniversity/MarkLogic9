And I'm so Glad to know I'm not the only one who faces resistance to what's good for me. I, too, get Anxiety when I write morning pages - I thought it was just me! And my meditation practice is one that is pretty often a struggle. It used to really bother me, but I guess you're right - why be so hard on ourselves? It may just be a part of who we are, or part of our journey. We've gotta accept all of it, even the annoying parts. ;)Â  Thanks for a great, relateable post! </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h5tfz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/c0o0</id></website><link>http://tinybuddha.com/blog/why-we-find-it-hard-to-do-things-that-are-good-for-us/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T05:35:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:52:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m39j8i</id><link>http://tinybuddha.com/blog/why-we-find-it-hard-to-do-things-that-are-good-for-us/#comment-479938710</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6cw5g</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
