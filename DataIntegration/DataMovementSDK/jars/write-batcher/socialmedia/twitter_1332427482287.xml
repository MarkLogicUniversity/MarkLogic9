I find it astounding that whoever made those predictions only has the D-Backs at 32% when they were the best in the NL West and they improved over the offseason by getting Cahill. That's WSJ's opinion and I have mine. The Indians are the 7th most contending team and they will be a good team but the  will most likely run away with the AL Central and with all of the teams like the Rangers, Angels, and the teams of the AL East, it will be overwhelming for them to try and get a Wild Card Spot. 

As for interleague play, it could be due to one or two teams faltering could ruin it for the entire league. The Al won 131 games last year and the NL 121. That's a difference of ten games meaning if the NL had just pulled Off 5 more wins they would have been tied with the AL. It's not that big of a difference. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6drorg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120320%26content_id=27459136%26vkey=news_mlb%26c_id=mlb</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T02:09:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T14:44:28+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mp0byb</id><link>http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120320%26content_id=27459136%26vkey=news_mlb%26c_id=mlb#comment-473633914</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/e3tl4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
