What part of "yeah, I have" was so hard to understand? Â I specifically said that I've dealt with the same thing too. Â Stop Acting like your problems are unique. Â I know how much it hurts to learn that your parents aren't perfect when you think that this sort of thing would never happen to you. Â I know just how damaging dysfunctional families can be. Â Yes, what your mother (and OP's mother, and my father) did was awful and wrong, but it's not worth Burning your bridges. Â Your mother lost her husband. Â Isn't that enough punishment?</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lwl4r</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dypr</id></website><link>http://www.sixbillionsecrets.com/view/Self-esteem/1601558</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T23:01:17+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:27:19+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3jzxi</id><link>http://www.sixbillionsecrets.com/view/Self-esteem/1601558#comment-479969202</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g1714</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
