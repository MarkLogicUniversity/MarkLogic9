No blood once and some small amount the second. Other times I didn&amp;#039;t even know it was broken. I&amp;#039;ve had my head smashed into a brick wall and no blood dripping as my hair soaked it up. I&amp;#039;ve also had my head smashed into a fire hydrant and only small amount of blood although knocked out Cold for at least 5 minutes and stomped on my whole body. Not much blood but lots of broken bones. like ribs mostly. So it all Depends. I also lost a streetfight to a golden gloves champ. Too bad he was a bleeder. I caught him with two jabs and a couple straight rights to his 100 landed. Didn&amp;#039;t matter as he was all bloodied up about the face. He looked like shi* but wasn&amp;#039;t even hurting.  I ran around after the fight claiming I kicked his bloody a&amp;amp;&amp;amp;. Too funny although I could hardly breathe from the beating.   </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:28381:127761776</id><idPostId>127761776</idPostId><idBlogId>28381</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:28381</id><idBlogId>28381</idBlogId><link>http://www.komonews.com</link><displayName>KOMO - Seattle, WA</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.komonews.com/news/national/-Trayvon-Martins-parents-seize-on-video-of-shooter-144941875.html</link><displayName>Trayvon Martin\'s parents seize on video of shooter | National &amp; World News | Seattle News, Weather,</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:32:29.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:28381:127761776:327524701</id><inReplyTo><link>http://www.komonews.com/news/national/-Trayvon-Martins-parents-seize-on-video-of-shooter-144941875.html#IDComment327307981</link></inReplyTo><link>http://www.komonews.com/news/national/-Trayvon-Martins-parents-seize-on-video-of-shooter-144941875.html#IDComment327524701</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:32:29.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Trayvon Martin\'s parents seize on video of shooter | National &amp; World News | Seattle News, Weather, by refinedgentry</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://intensedebate.com/people/refinedgentry</link><idEmailMd5>a89b61828c9ca7a1700b75453d671f29</idEmailMd5><displayName>refinedgentry</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/people/refinedgentry"&gt;refinedgentry&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/national/-Trayvon-Martins-parents-seize-on-video-of-shooter-144941875.html"&gt;Trayvon Martin\'s parents seize on video of shooter | National &amp; World News | Seattle News, Weather,&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
