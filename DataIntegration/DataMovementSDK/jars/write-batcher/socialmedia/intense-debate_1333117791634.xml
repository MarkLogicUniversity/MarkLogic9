He didn't even Bounce back in the NICU as quick as they assumed. And the NICU dr's said he'd be more susceptible to becoming an asthmatic.
No-they haven't done any cultures. Up until now-they were just treating his ears and thinking the antibiotics would knock out the Cough too. They were assuming it was a Cold etc. The antibiotics aren't touching his ears either. But since the Cough hasn't gotten any better and has stayed wet....now they worry. It's all so frustrating. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hk6of</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7fwk</id></website><link>http://mwopblog.com/2012/03/open-floor-43/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T21:47:06+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:34:40+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3f5dm</id><link>http://mwopblog.com/2012/03/open-floor-43/#comment-479862439</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/radt</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
