I like ACab's play alot but let's not fall in love with the talent.

What I see is too few trades.....the team has excellent prospects (Barnes, Chis, Hagadone, Chen Lee) that may or may not get to the MLB team not because they can't play but because they are blocked. We have Hafner creating a log jam because of his long contract and blocking the team's best power hitter, Santana, from his natural DH position. We have guys like Donald hitting well who can't find a Spot to play regularly and players like Brantley who may break out this year.....or not. 

This team will be OK but it won't contend for the Central crown or anything further than that. Enough withÂ the veteran presence theory. Let's do what they did with Masterson in 2010 at every position where we have some good potential MLB talent available. They have to learn how to play at this level at some point.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hwj8a</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120328%26content_id=27704042%26vkey=news_cle%26c_id=cle</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T01:08:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:14:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3kd7h</id><link>http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120328%26content_id=27704042%26vkey=news_cle%26c_id=cle#comment-480147817</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gy3l6</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
