Two excerpts that I'll briefly comment on:

"The Government Accountability Office last week projected it would cost $397 billion to develop and buy the planes, up from its earlier forecast of $382 billion." This concurs w/ the Feb. 14/12 announcement by Pentagon and Lockheed Martin officials that the cost of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) will rise.

"The new baseline forecasts the average cost of the F-35 fighter, including research and development (R&amp;D) and inflation, at $135 million per plane, plus an additional $26 million for the F135 engine built by Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp.

"In 2012 dollars, the average cost of each single-seat, single-engine plane, including R&amp;D, would be $112.5 million, plus $22 million for the engine."

These cost no.'s are for unmodified F-35s. Modifying a  of F-35A's for Canada - w/ the correct mid-air refuelling system, drag chute, and SATCOM (satellite communications) equipment that works in the Arctic (as reported in the past 14 months), and a Cold weather operations kit (presumably) - would be millions extra per JSF.

Folks, we're talking about a warplane that could EASILY cost us $145+ MILLION per copy, not the Cons' fantastical $75M. At that price, we'd be on the hook for a 65-aircraft Joint Strike Fighter  for more than $13.5B, 50+ percent MORE than what the Harper Cons. have been telling us since the summer of 2010.

If the Harper govt. is going to cap the procurement at $9B, the RCAF will be LUCKY to get 35 modified F-35A's, not the 65 jets that military planners have said are needed to protect Canada &amp; participate in intl. missions.

And to think that in early 2010, the Con. govt. rejected Boeing's amazing offer of new F/A-18 Super Hornets - good enough for the U.S. Navy &amp; Aussie air force, BTW - for as little as $55M apiece, per the June 7/10 Le Devoir newspaper report (Google "Avions de chasse: l'armÃ©e a fait son choix" to read it &amp; use Yahoo Babelfish to translate, if required).
