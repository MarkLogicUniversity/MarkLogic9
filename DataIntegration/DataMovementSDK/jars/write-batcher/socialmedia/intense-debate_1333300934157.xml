He will not select Fernando Reges. 
He will not give many chances to Willian. 
He will not select Felipe Luis Kasmirski. 
He insists on playing Elias again and again. 
He is after Ronaldinho knowing fully well that Ronaldinho is not serious at all and is playing the fool.
And the mistakes go and on.

Perhaps Mano should learn from Pele. 
Pele at least reads and takes a page out of this book. 
But when will Mano learn? Hopefuly not after Brazil lose the WC in 2014 in front of their home fans. The fan will take their wrath out on Mano. They will Burn him alive. Only then they will feel that justice is done.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ziuve</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dd6r</id></website><link>http://brazil.worldcupblog.org/world-cup-2010/the-greatest-brazil-goal-of-all-time.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:55:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T11:34:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwpfwk</id><link>http://brazil.worldcupblog.org/world-cup-2010/the-greatest-brazil-goal-of-all-time.html#comment-481756855</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
