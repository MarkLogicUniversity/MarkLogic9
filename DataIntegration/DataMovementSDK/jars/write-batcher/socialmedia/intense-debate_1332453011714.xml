I&amp;#039;m betting the real ending will come as DLC but i would find it a low punch if it wasn&amp;#039;t free. 
 
Check the link of Burninice and it will become more clear on all that happens in the endscenes. Especially the part where you see sheppard take a breather in the rubble of London only when you choose the destroy option is good proof of this. 
 
Also check the kid the godkid represents. Only Sheppard seems to notice the kid at the start. Anderson doesn&amp;#039;t hear or see the kid when Sheppard Spots him in the ducts and when he boards the shuttle none of the soldiers apparently sees him or lends the kid a hand. The kid was created by the Reapers in his mind to dent his Resolve and willpower. It would leave him more vulnerable to their influences. 
 
Remember the 3 different choices: 
 
Control -&amp;gt; Illusive man&amp;#039;s solution -&amp;gt; indoctrinated 
Synthesis -&amp;gt; Saren&amp;#039;s solution -&amp;gt; indoctrinated 
Destroy -&amp;gt; Sheppard&amp;#039; s plan -&amp;gt; until then not fully indoctrinated.  
 
Also the renegade choices with Anderson points to the sequence being wrong and thus a dreamstate 
 
Just watch the video and play the endscene again. You will notice the subtle hints at the indoctrination attempt
