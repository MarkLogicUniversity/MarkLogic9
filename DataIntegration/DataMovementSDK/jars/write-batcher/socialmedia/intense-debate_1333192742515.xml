We need to have some strategic steps for the Dust Bowl-strength drought that Texas and other parts of the South have been having.Â  And, while we are at it, figure out what to do with all those dead trees in the Pacific Northwest that were weakened by Heat and finished Off by insects, leaving a lot of firewood.Â  Plus make some preparation for the health risks in summer Heat waves, particularly if combined with power outages.Â  We have enough to worry about in the near future.
