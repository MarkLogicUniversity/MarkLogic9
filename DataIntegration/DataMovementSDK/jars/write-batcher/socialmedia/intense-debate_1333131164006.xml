     As evidence mounts that the "birth certificate" released by Team Obama is a "computer-generated forgery,"  EVEN MORE shocking revelations are coming out that Barack Obama's surrogates and far-left power-brokers are engaged in a massive and tyrannical effort to SILENCE the conservative media from reporting on Mr. Obama's eligibility. 

     However, there's some good news to report as well. A few brave souls in the conservative media are finally daring to break the silence. Diana West, who writes for The Washington Times, recently blew the whistle: "Clearly, something has us all on lockdown. Thatâ€™s much, much scarier than even the amazing possibility that some con artist might be pulling  the biggest scam in history." 

     And, as we previous reported, Mike Zullo, the lead investigator of Sheriff Joe Arpaio's Cold Case Posse stated; "During our investigation, we actually were told [that media] had been threatened with FTC investigations. Commentators [had been] threatened with their jobs.â€&#157; And according to WND.com, the "threats were so intimidating that some individuals quit their positions over safety concerns for their families." 

    
     The Obama Regime is not just illegitimate... now that the illegitimacy and tyrannical abuses of the Obama White House are finally starting to see the light of day, 


More Allegations Of Threats... 
     Radio talk show host Mark Gillar recently stated: "One of the things you hear on the street is that they're [members of the media] being threatened. You hear rumors of the White House threatening to use the full force of the FCC or... the FTC to come after them if they don't get in line." 

     But the threat allegations appear to more than rumors. Dr. Jerome Corsi, stated that the Cold Case Posse is looking into allegations of threats being issued to members of the media and is actively pursuing those allegations: 

     "Testimony is being developed that the White House is intimidating, in a systematic way, the mainstream media and if any broadcasters dare go into this birther story, they're going to risk FCC investigations... people are going to have careers ruined... thrown Off the air." 

     If Corsi's is correct, it would explain a great many things: 
  
   It might explain why CNN mysteriously released commentator Lou Dobbs from his contract two years ago because he refused to stop reporting on the controversy behind Obama's "birth certificate." 

   It would explain why Glenn Beck was suddenly released from his contract with FOX News even though he had one of the highest rated shows in cable television at the time. While Beck actively refused to investigate the legitimacy of Mr. Obama's "birth certificate," it was clear that his reporting, on a host of other issues, put him on the Obama Regime's hit list. 

   And it would explain why talk show host Sean Hannity recently said that back in 2008 he was specifically told, on multiple occasions, that his continued insistence on reporting on the Jeremiah Wright-Obama connection could be career-ending. 
     Obviously, more is going on than meets the eye, and obviously... something has been afoot for a long time; but if you're thinking that the media is not reporting this story out of an honest belief that there's nothing there... or out of misguided arrogance... or elitism... think again. 

     Diane West again: "One editor told me the problem is the evidence of fraud might prove to be true! A very famous conservative figure told me that if the president were proved to be an identity thief, 'that would alienate too many people.'"
