Inderstood that when Sarkozy was first elected, he  to bring the riots in the affected neighborhoods to an end. In any repubique, when the police and fire are attacked for being in certain neighborhoods, it is then time to let them Burn when their residents set them on fire, and it is time to cut Off their benefits from the state as well. There is no valid reason for ahy extremism in any republic at any time whatsoever. That is just my opinion of how Republics actually work, and most people here, do not understand how a republic actually works.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6dp1g4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6rx1</id></website><link>http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/53763016-68/suspect-police-french-building.html.csp</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T14:51:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T01:15:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miy36s</id><link>http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/53763016-68/suspect-police-french-building.html.csp#comment-474114776</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c850x</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
