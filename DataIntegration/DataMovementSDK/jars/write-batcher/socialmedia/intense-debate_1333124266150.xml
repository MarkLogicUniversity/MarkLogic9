FROM ONEW TO TAEMIN:
Little Cute Taemin-ah, I really donâ€™t know what to say, because I say too much usually.
You are a dance-genius and your dancing overshadows us hyungs. Your singing abilities are getting better and better, so is your rap. (SIGH)Looking at you, I feel like there is much for me to improve.As the maknae of the group, you wonâ€™t be bullied by hyung, but will be held in my palms (to be loved/adored a lot-around that meaning, I think) , cherished/loved, and afraid that you will be treated unfairly. Making your debut at only 9/10th grade(?), you needed to practice and study, but even if youâ€™re not able to achieve both at once/must choose one or the other, you still try to do your best. Every morning, I canâ€™t bear to wake you up, wishing that you can have more sleep, so instead, I give you bbq meat to eat for breakfast. Although you  say that you donâ€™t know aegyo, but your every movement shows your cuteness, letting us hyungs canâ€™t help loving you. Even HoDong ajusshi likes hugging you. You getting shy at the first interview and the first date, but once you start dancing, you are full of confidence. Your expression and powerful movements even makes us hyungs jealous of you. When we talked about family, the crying you made me so sad and also think of my family that I have not seen for long, but I cannot cry, because I have to be strong to be your hyung. Watermelon Taemin (his hair when he first debut lol), a cute name. Although the watermelon head bothered you for a long time, but that let a lot of people notice, understand, and love you like a son and niece. Although some people call us as father and son, others support us as ONTAEM couple, you  smile shyly and not say anything, and putting this as noona-fansâ€™ love. In TV shows, you said the hyung that looks after you best is me, it made me very happy and pleased, but I  feel that the hyung you like best is KEY, maybe its because he helps you the most. Iâ€™m not jealous, but I feel that I should be doing better. Although I am a kid to others, you are, too, a kid to me, curious to everything and brave to accept it all. Debuting at 15, let me, as a hyung, lead you to the bright future, let us, together, become the most shiny newcomer(?) idol!

y la de Taemin a Onew:

Onew hyung:

Thank you, thank you for your care for me, thank you for your care(Its different in chinese, but the same translated to english soâ€¦..), thank you for your encouragement.

Every hyung in the group treats me very well, but Onew-hyung is the leader, gives me, the maknae, a lot more care than others, and I can fee it; Key-hyung is like a mother, sometimes  joking around me, and sometimes a strict omma, but I know that is only to tease me(as in  me up; not the negative meaning); donâ€™t think that I like Key-hyung more, because actually my love for all the hyungs is the same, especially the Onew-hyung that gives me meat in the morning and sends me to school; sometimes Onew-hyung him(your)self cannot feel how good you are to others, but I can feel it, so I am very thankful to you.

Dancing is when I should feel the most confident, so sometimes Iâ€™ll seem to be more powerful(as in on stage), but this is not to let Onew-hyung feel inadequate, this is really not what I meant, its only let out unaturally(???).

Actually the Onew-hyung that loves to say Cold jokes is interesting, and sometimes will say hilarious stuff. I  liked to laugh, so listening to Onew-hyungâ€™s Cold jokes are also interesting.

About CP(couple), Iâ€™ve heard a bit about it, but I think its probably because Iâ€™m  with Onew-hyung and is sometimes too reliant on Onew-hyung, so the noonas misunderstood, but I think this shows that my relationship with Onew-hyungâ€™s is the best.

I have not seen my family for a long time, and I miss father, mother, and hyung a lot, so when they are mentioned, it is hard to control my emotions, but Onew-hyung will  gently place his hands on my shoulders/hug my shoulders(somewhere in between), giving me strength and giving me warmth, letting the sadness in my heart slowly disappear, and gradually I started taking Onew-hyung as my family.

I can get warmth from hyung when Iâ€™m sad, encouragement when Iâ€™m done, and when Iâ€™m happy, I can be happy together with hyung. I share everything in my heart with Onew-hyung.

The me from today onwards, will be growing with SHINee, and I believe that Onew-hyung will lead us even further. Lastly, I want to whisper/softly say â€œI love you, Onew-hyung!â€&#157; Thank you for everything youâ€™ve done for me, you will Always be the best hyung ever!
