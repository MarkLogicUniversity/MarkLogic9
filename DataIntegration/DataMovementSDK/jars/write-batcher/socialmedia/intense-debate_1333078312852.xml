B4 last Spr Tng, Barney appeared to be battling for the last roster Spot with AuggieO and Blake Dw was likely to be the everyday 2B. But Auggie got hurt and was subseq'tly farmed out, Blake Dw was poor all camp and was lucky to make the team at all. Baker had fldg woes. So for combo of reasons, Blake ended up with a back-up role, a role he was lucky to get after a woeful camp. Barney earned his starting role with an impressive Spr Tng and early season hot streak...

The idea that anybody is being held back by Castro is laughable dunce listing. He was Always gonna be the starting SS, no ques about it,,,and is by far, the best SS in the org.
