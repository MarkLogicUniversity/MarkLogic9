But this episode could lead to a new direction.  The writers should keep going with establishing Jeff as a lower-class but hardworking guy, trying to do what's right for his wife and himself.  He'll never be remotely as insane as everyone else, but at least he can be a useful straight man for the others to play Off (as he was here), and some political conflict between Jeff and Stan could work too.  They should establish his shtick as "I need to work because I'm broke", which could lead to funny tangles with Roger's schemes or CIA business.
