it's 4.5/5 for me!
BE MINE as title track is just perfect
BECAUSE is just love of 1st listen to me, well done leader
WOOHYUN's time is just mind blowing
You never thought that AMAZING and JULIA are actually sad songs with refreshing rhythm
HOYA&amp;DONGWOO bring back Epik High style which I miss
L's voice bring uniqueness
SUNGJONG&amp;SUNGYEOL are getting more lines as they are improving!
TIC TOC is just my favorite song all time, it's so different
Their dance is magnificent and can be compared with SHINEE but sychronization hands down to INFINITE
their themes/concepts are not like any other groups, they  bring something new to the table
even though they are not from big company, all the MVs are well done
I'm Glad that they are getting recognition that they deserve since they debut
Seriously, what could you ask for more from INFINITE except you are hoping to watch their concerts?
I proudly say that I have INFINITE album because they are worth it &lt;3
