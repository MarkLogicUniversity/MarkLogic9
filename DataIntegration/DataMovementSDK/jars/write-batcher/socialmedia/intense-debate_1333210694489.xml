"And indeed in Bradford some of his appeal to the voters was
 couched in sectional and religious language unprecedented in the past 
60 years of British politics. 

One of his leaflets began thus: â€œGod KNOWS
 who is a Muslim. And he KNOWS who is not. Instinctively, so do you. Let
 me point out to all the Muslim brothers and sisters what I stand for.â€&#157;Â  Further
 down Mr Galloway laid claim to leading the decent, pious life: â€œI, 
George Galloway, do not drink alcohol and never have. Ask yourself if 
you believe the other candidate in this election can say that 
truthfully.â€&#157;
While readers pick themselves up Off the floor, I 
should add that those who have followed Mr Galloway for years will smile
 at the omission of adultery from the list of vices he abjures. I should
 just add that almost no Galloway event or pronouncement is now complete
 without several invocations of â€œAllahâ€&#157; in one form or another.

To
 get an idea of the strangeness of this, try to imagine a campaign in 
Hendon South where the winning candidate addresses voters with the 
sentiment â€œG-d knows who is a Jew and who is notâ€&#157;, boasts to the 
electorate that he keeps kosher and then implies that his opponent has 
been Spotted mixing milk and meat. Such religiosity is rarely seen in 
British politics, thank the Eternal One, the Lord of Hosts...
