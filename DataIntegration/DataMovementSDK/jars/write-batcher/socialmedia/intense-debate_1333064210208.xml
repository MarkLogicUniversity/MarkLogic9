2. we wasn't on the fields
stupid, go do other cultures history. you had the afro-american on the field
not us. as i recall it is you white americans that are trying to be black by
openning up a tanning salon in america, have tanning rubbing lotion &amp; love
to go to the beach &amp; not hit the polluted waters but wanna lay on the sand
all day tossing &amp; turning to get a good Burn just to be black. get the fuk
Off the sand because people need to walk around &amp; play sports on the sanded
beach. i noticed that it's you people all over the world trying to be black
period so it goes both ways. look what your fore-fathers did to the
afro-american negro women by making their new generations EUROPEAN/NEGRO'S,
what happen......white girls puzzy isn't good enough anymore that your
fore-fathers had to have the best black puzzy by raping what they couldn't have
in america to the slaves.
