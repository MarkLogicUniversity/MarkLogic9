When that is done there might be some hope that people will stop blaming the bankers; the immigrants; the weather; the politicians; the judges; political correctness; doctors; lorry drivers; the education system; unmarried mothers; savage dogs; Muslims; Blacks; Murdoch and Cold pasties. 

You do not make enough money and you spend far too much. You have to cut defence almost completely and invest in Britsih owned industrial efforts that employ British people. You need to re-skill for this and &lt;i&gt;force&lt;/i&gt; people Off the dole and back to work while stopping all immigration except that which passes stringent work permit rulings.
