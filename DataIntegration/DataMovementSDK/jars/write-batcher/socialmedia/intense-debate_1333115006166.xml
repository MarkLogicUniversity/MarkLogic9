The major news of today are again the enormous defections and there are more to come
There now negotiations About whole Army units to defect
The sitation on the ground is That all City's are still in Hands of the SFA most civilians got out of the way or to the countryside or to Turkey or Lebanon
This makes defending much easier
in and around Aleppo Idlib Maarat Hama Ratan All the Way to Al Nabk And beyond to the heart of Damascus Sfa is in Control The Radom Attacks form The fire bases and other military installations are going down very fast because of the Situation in the Capital
The Homs Sfa is working very Hard to get the bad streets back that ASSad troops took in the offensive where Maher Al ASSad was killed in his BMP and Burned
Sfa are now taking base by baseÂ  to stop the shelling some Bases just defect
The Flow of guns big and small from outside is stepped up further they have now also Stinger Missiles
On Mil 24  Squadron defected to the SFA near Damascus
The CoastalÂ  towns of Tartoes Banias and Latakia are now in total Uprising this ASSad heartland
Mukhbarat and Shabiba Act very brutal to stop this but its to late they are not in control any more
Damascus is split in three parts The goverment area is heavy under atack but still under regime control the Airport is and the presidential mountain and the airbase on the foot of this mountain
The Rest is under SFA Control
Heavy fighting also around Air fore intelligence Headquarters ans other Mukhabarat buildings
Zabadani and Demas SFA played a very important role in this
Al Nabk SFA contacted Duma SFA via Al Rankus
Main target now is Damascus International to blockÂ  the way out
Bridge number 6 is now theres This is the Last Viaduct before the Airport
Deraa province is now In much better control of the SFA they take Army base by army bas one by one
some times they fight Some times they surrender and most of the time they defect
Recongroups already contacted Zabadani/Demas SSA south of Damascus
SFA in Dar Al Zor province the SFA and Iraq Sunni clean out military Bases and compounds
There is Touch fighting near Palmyra 
The Flow of out side Modern and Heavy weapons is good and undisturbed 
Also Many trainers and instructors come in to help out
SFA WILL AND SHALL PREVAIL
