Now that I finally finished the game I can't help but be happy that they are going to try and "fix" the ending. I don't need more closure, I want a different ending.Â 

I think the Crucible should have been a ruse by the reapers to get everyone one in the same Spot to kill them. Only to have the  beat the reapers anyway. They built up how no cycle had Banned together like this before. Why not have the twist at the end be the reapers own plan back firing on them?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/66zsq7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7d9s</id></website><link>http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/122/1221492p1.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-23T20:15:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T09:13:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkn1tc</id><link>http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/122/1221492p1.html#comment-476296167</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g9lu7</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-23</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
