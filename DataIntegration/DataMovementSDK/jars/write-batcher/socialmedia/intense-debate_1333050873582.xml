 have been a member of the BNP since 2004 (before that I was with the 
National Front), and have been through all manner of attempts to 
slander, scandalise, ridicule, silence or suppress the legitimate and 
well-founded views of the British National Party (Iâ€™ve even had my 
e-mail account trashed; my mobile phone number scrambled and closed down
 (by Virgin Mobile); Iâ€™ve been prevented by my local public libraries 
(run by the local council) from accessing the BNP Web site on their 
Internet computers, and have even been blacklisted by the on-line news 
media and Face Book and barred from posting any commentsâ€”not because I 
have committed some sort of heinous crime, like push drugs, traffic 
people, molest children, robbed a bank or flown a jumbo jet into a 
skyscraper, but simply because I have a difference of opinion), but 
after watching the puerile and amateur attempts of the alleged 
â€˜comedianâ€™ Keith Allen to humiliate and embarrass Nick Griffin in the 
above television program, I feel I have no choice but to retaliate to 
this latest and spiteful attempt by the Marxist Left to denigrate and 
insult someone with a perfectly legitimate and valid opposite opinion 
(an opposite opinion that is held, I might add, by millions of 
indigenous British people here in the UKâ€”but who are too frightened of 
the Marxist Left bullies to stand up and say so).

The very first 
thing that struck me immediately (and remained with me throughout the 
whole broadcast) was how the interviewer and the program format itself, 
slavishly followed the same old predictable routine of confrontational 
hostility (in fact, this approach has become a major hallmark of 
interviewing technique with the Marxist Left for quite some time now).Â  I
 donâ€™t know about the rest of you, but I really am tired of seeing and 
hearing this sort of insolent approach to someoneâ€”anyoneâ€”who has a valid
 critical opinion of the lawless, fear-ridden and degenerate society the
 Marxist Left have forced every indigenous person in Britain to submit 
to and accept.

This sort of interviewing template has become so 
common and so predictable that it has actually become a hackneyed 
interviewing clichÃ© (you know whatâ€™s coming before it happensâ€”the 
institutional prejudice of the Leftist BBC proved that back in 2009 when
 Nick Griffin appeared on Question Time) and it is because of this that 
such interviews are not only predictable in their content and approach, 
but tiresome to watch and boring to listen to as well.Â  But what these 
â€˜interviewsâ€™ also illustrate is the prejudice, the discrimination and 
the frightening depth and degree of the stranglehold the Marxist Left 
now have on our alleged â€˜free speechâ€™; our radio and television 
broadcasts; our publishing media, and even on the minds of the 
population.Â  British people were once free to speak their minds openly 
and without fear on any subject they wish, but now they live in fear of 
upsetting the Marxist Left in case they are bullied, pilloried, 
victimised, persecuted or even prosecuted.Â  This is how â€˜freeâ€™ we have 
become in Britain now!

Before proceeding further, let me introduce a 
disclaimer here: for the benefit of the Marxist Left and all those who 
hate hearing the truth (and all those who would bully and insult anyone 
and everyone who seeks to speak the truthâ€”including those who read and 
scrutinise everything on our Website in order to try and find someone to
 prosecute), there are things happening in our society that the 
indigenous people of Britain donâ€™t agree with (and never have agreed 
with) but are being forced by threat of law or victimisation to accept 
or at least keep silent about; things that need to be said if only for 
the sake of the safety and welfare of the people and the safety and 
security of the realmâ€”and itâ€™s about time someone stood up and said 
them!Â  Therefore, everything that follows in this posting is not 
necessarily the official or general view of the BNP, or of the Web 
master of the BNP Web site, or of any of its party members.Â  The 
following views, comments, opinions and observations are exclusively my 
views and observations and mine alone (the principle I invoke is this: 
as long as I donâ€™t tell lies about anyone, or slander or dishonour the 
good name and character of an innocent person, then I will say whatever I
 please in whatever way I please in my own country), so if you donâ€™t 
want to hear the truth about the kind of Britain we are living in, then 
donâ€™t read this posting; better still, leave this Web site now!

First
 of all, I am very angry with Nick Griffin, not because of his 
performance in the actual interview (Nickâ€™s performance was okay), but 
because he actually allocated some of his valuable time to a scruffy 
Marxist anal dysfunctionary like Allen to interview him.Â  Personally, I 
would not have given Allen the time of day, let alone an interview, 
until he had at least smartened himself up a bit and made himself a 
little more presentable. Â Apart from the fact that Allen had an 
atrocious dress sense and a limited vocabulary, he was also in desperate
 need of a good wash and a shave (he has to be the scruffiest looking 
interviewer I have ever seen).Â  Allenâ€™s persona was even worse!Â  The 
character and demeanour Allen projected was about as pleasant and 
palatable as drinking a pint of tubercular phlegm!Â  Allen was typical of
 the great unwashed Marxist street bully now at large in our society.Â  I
 would also have arranged to have an independent video recording made of
 the entire interview (recorded by our own BNP technicians) in case of 
any â€˜politically correctâ€™ editing or â€˜accidentalâ€™ omissions of the main 
points of contention brought out during the interview.

Lefty Alan, 
replete with obscene language, insults, puerile schoolyard graphics, 
scurrilous remarks and, for some strange reason known only to himself, 
clutching a silly little ukulele throughout the whole program (at one 
point I thought he was going to break into a George Formby routine), 
Allen displayed the very attitudes he accuses Nick Griffin and the Far 
Right of having, but then Allen (like all good Marxists anal 
dysfunctionaries) was too stupid to realise this.Â  It goes without 
saying that in â€˜politically correctâ€™ Marxist Britain today, if Nick 
Griffin had been a black or mixed race sodomite with multiple â€˜partnersâ€™
 fathering illegitimate children and championing â€˜politically correctâ€™ 
Leftist views he would be in Westminster by now along with all the other
 Leftist Anglophobic quislings.

Lefty Allen promised the viewers at 
the start of the program to conduct a â€˜fairâ€™ interview without insult, 
barracking or  anyone down (is Allen trying to be funny?).Â  
Allen didnâ€™t  anyone down, but he certainly reneged on the other 
salient aspects of his promise (once again, what else can you expect 
from a good Marxist anal dysfunctionary?).Â  His amateur schoolyard 
efforts to â€˜interviewâ€™ Nick Griffin did nothing to vindicate his claim 
of being â€˜fairâ€™ and â€˜unbiasedâ€™ or even â€˜tolerantâ€™.Â  In actual fact, as 
the program progressed, Allen was (of course) the exact opposite: 
instead of allowing Nick Griffin to express his views without any 
hostility or interjection, Allen went out of his way to be 
confrontational in almost everything Nick said.Â  Not only that, but I 
happen to know for a fact that many of the major salient and pertinent 
points Nick brought out in the original interview were deliberately 
edited out (deleted) from the final cut by the Channel 4 program 
producers (for â€˜politically correctâ€™ reasons you understand) before 
being broadcast. Â Thatâ€™s why I would have arranged to have our own BNP 
recording of the interview made.Â  Even the Cannel 4 camera crew seem to 
be going out of their way to find the most unflattering camera angle of 
Nick Griffin as the interview progressed.

Allen (a convicted 
criminal, a drunkard, a serial fornicator and father of several children
 by different women) even let his equally brainless and malicious 
daughter (who looks like a mongrelised individual with no genuine Anglo 
Saxon identityâ€”and was perhaps conceived and born out of wedlock as well
 in order to reflect Allenâ€™s politically correct Marxist Leftist morals)
 stick her twopennâ€™orth in by â€˜composingâ€™ some sort of a silly 
schoolyard â€˜songâ€™ she had allegedly written. Â This monotonous â€˜songâ€™ (a 
tuneless rant would be a better description) had no sense of musical 
melody or synchronised rhyme, clumsy syncopation and, yes, youâ€™ve 
guessed it, verbal insults, obscene language and anti-BNP rhetoric (like
 father, like daughter, eh?).Â  Well, thereâ€™s nothing like keeping 
Marxist anal dysfunctionaries all in the family is there?!Â  This is an 
example of good old-fashioned Marxist â€˜fairnessâ€™, Marxist â€˜equalityâ€™ and
 Marxist â€˜toleranceâ€™ in action.Â  It would appear that the only practical
 function that Allen and his â€˜daughterâ€™ (and all those like Allen) have 
is to convert oxygen into carbon dioxide.Â  If this had been Communist 
Soviet Russia, Nick Griffin and everyone in the BNP would have been 
rounded up and packed  to a Gulag in Siberia for â€˜re-educationâ€™ years
 ago (in fact, there have been many in the Marxist Left who have 
actually gone on record as recommending that all BNP members should be 
rounded up and shot in the back of the head). Â I daresay it will come to
 this in the end.Â  God, where the hell do these two-faced hypocrites 
come from?

Unknown to himself, Allen betrayed his Marxist Leftist 
credentials right from the very start: he came out with the usual 
â€˜politically correctâ€™ Diarrhoea of platitudes and phrases now so 
familiar to all of us and inserted the customary â€˜politically correctâ€™ 
caveats and provisos required of every interviewer if they are to have 
their interview broadcast on national television: â€˜politically correctâ€™ 
caveats like â€˜tiny minorityâ€™ (this despicable caveat is now so common 
and nauseous to listen to you will never see or hear an interview 
dealing with crime and terrorism in the UK without it; it is forever 
being invoked and used to excuse the alarming spread of armed black 
criminal gangs on our streets; to excuse Muslim terrorism in the UK; to 
minimise the massive influx of organised crime from Eastern Europe; and 
even to justifyâ€”or at least camouflageâ€”the presence and growing menace 
of militant Islam in Britain and Europe).Â  Yet another caveat often 
heard is â€˜celebrate our rich diversityâ€™ (this daft and wholly offensive 
phrase is used to justify the lawless multicultural sewer of crime, 
terrorism and fear the Marxist Left have forced the British people to 
accept over the decades without their consent).Â  In actual fact, you can
 Spot a Marxist Socialist immediately from their use of these daft 
politically correct phrases they parrot.

Keith Allen displayed and 
defended these exact same attitudes and hostility in his interview.Â  You
 have to understand, dear reader, that â€˜fairâ€™ and â€˜unbiasedâ€™ interviews 
dealing with politically incorrect subject matter do not exist in the 
UK. Â All information and imagery you see on television (which is the 
biggest and most far- influential â€˜politically correctâ€™ 
brainwashing tool in existence today) are all strictly controlled, 
scrutinised and vetted for its â€˜political correctnessâ€™ before being 
released for public consumption.Â  A major part of this deliberately 
engineered brainwashing control is to brand the truth about many social 
and religious ills as â€˜racistâ€™, â€˜offensiveâ€™, â€˜fascistâ€™ and â€˜phobicâ€™.Â  
Consequently, simply speaking the truth on many social and religious 
issues is now openly branded a â€˜hate crimeâ€™ (in politically correct 
Britain you can be prosecuted and sent to jail for speaking the 
truthâ€”much like the Middle Ages where it was a capital offence to read 
or even possess a copy of the Bible).Â  This is why the Marxist Left are 
trying so desperately to get a stranglehold on the freedom of the 
Internet.Â  The Internet is the last bastion of free speech left.Â  Once 
the freedom of the Internet goes, your free speech is gone forever.
You
 may have also noticed that for all the years the British National 
Party, the National Front, the English Defence League, and all the other
 right-wing movements have been going, no one has ever stood up and 
accused any of them of telling lies!Â  This is because these 
organisations have not told any lies about anyone or anything, they have
 only told the truth!Â  We have centuries-old laws protecting people from
 malicious lies, slander and libel, so why havenâ€™t these groups been 
prosecuted if what they are saying is untrue?Â  So, to get round this 
predicament, the Marxist Left came up with an idea: the way to stop 
people telling the truth about all the negative aspects of their â€˜social
 engineeringâ€™ program is to outlaw the truth and brand the truth a â€˜hate
 crimeâ€™.Â  What was it the great political and social seer George Orwell 
once said?Â  â€œIn a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a 
revolutionary .â€&#157; Â I donâ€™t know about the rest of you, but I rather 
like being a revolutionary!

Free speech in Britain is a Marxist myth,
 peddled by the Marxist Left in order to keep the unthinking population 
of Britain intellectually anesthetised and submissive to Leftist views 
(more on this later).Â  The reason for this is simple: Britain is in a 
â€˜politically correctâ€™ Leftist straightjacket (and has been for quite 
some time) where only â€˜politically correctâ€™ Leftist views are allowed.Â  
Anything outside of that is either ridiculed, insulted, condemned, 
suppressed or even prosecutedâ€”in most cases all five.

In case you 
hadnâ€™t noticed, traditional free speech and the right to freedom of 
expression has been quietly and covertly destroyed in Britain (Enoch 
Powell found that out to his cost back in 1968); they have been expunged
 from our politics and social thinking and supplanted by compulsory 
â€˜political correctnessâ€™ and consequently, do not exist anymore (except 
in the BNPâ€”much to the fury of the Marxist Left who are continually 
trying to suppress it under the hypocritical faÃ§ade of United Against 
Fascism).Â  Today, you are only allowed â€˜politically correctâ€™ views and 
â€˜politically correctâ€™ free speech (which isnâ€™t real free speech at all, 
but simply a compulsory parroting of Marxist â€˜politically correctâ€™ 
phraseology designed to make people feel good about themselves and at 
the same time deny their own racial and cultural identity).

Compulsory
 â€˜political correctnessâ€™ has four major effects on the individual 
person: the compulsory suppression of your traditional right to free 
speech; the strangulation of your own logic and common sense; the 
compulsory denial of all the negative aspects the Marxist Left have 
inflicted on Britain and its people over the decades; and perhaps the 
most sinister aspect of all, the fear compulsory â€˜political correctnessâ€™
 generates if anyone dares to question it or oppose it.Â  If you donâ€™t 
want to lose your job or be passed over for promotion, or be insulted, 
harassed, bullied, victimised or persecuted, then you must become a 
â€˜politically correctâ€™ automaton (anything outside of that and youâ€™ve got
 trouble on your hands).Â  There is no room in the politically correct 
world of the Marxist Left for free thinkers, critics or honest, 
real-world observations (in the same way there is no room in the BNP for
 the politically correct brigade).Â  If you want to be a â€˜politically 
correctâ€™ automaton, then be one, but donâ€™t force others to be one if 
they donâ€™t want it.
What Keith Allen proved in his â€˜interviewâ€™ (if he
 proved anything at all) was that he is typical of the unwashed Marxist 
socialist bully that people have to contend with in Britain today.Â  You 
will all have to reconcile yourselves to the fact that there is no such 
thing in â€˜politically correctâ€™ Marxist Britain as a â€˜fairâ€™ and 
â€˜unbiasedâ€™ approach when dealing with opponents and critics of this 
oppressive and wholly suffocating destructive system of procrustean 
socialism (a system of socialism that completely wrecked communist 
soviet Russia and is now in the process of completely wrecking Britain, 
Europe, America and the rest of the western world).

In the world of 
the politically correct bully, you are told what to think; told what to 
believe and even told what you should see! Â Just like a â€˜politically 
correctâ€™ Dalek that goes around patrolling and monitoring its slaves, 
screeching its bullying orders in that caustic, grating computerised 
voice: â€˜Obey!...Obey!...Obey!...We command you to obey!Â  Or you will be 
exterminated!â€™ You can thank the Marxist Left for this situationâ€”and all
 those nitwits who keep voting them into office all the time.Â  They have
 systematically taken over and now control the whole of the news and 
broadcasting media in Britain, Europe, America and everywhere else where
 political correctness has a foothold.Â  They even control our 
educational systems as well (in fact, it all began in our universities 
and colleges back in the 1950s where it then percolated down into our 
politics, our communications media and social thinking).Â  Even with our 
own children today, we have to literally debrief them when they come 
home from school and rip out all the â€˜politically correctâ€™ wiring that 
has been â€˜engineeredâ€™ into their thinking during their classroom 
studies.Â  This has to be done if our children are to keep a firm tight 
grip on their own national identity, pride, culture and patriotism.Â  If 
you want to see a fair and unbiased interview on any subject, you have 
to watch foreign programs like RT.com

As
 the closing credits of the Keith Allen program were rolling, there was a
 semi-literate young man struggling to express his views to Allenâ€™s 
cameraman.Â  This was a deliberately engineered ploy by the Allen program
 makers to suggest that this is the sort of semi-literate moron who 
supports the BNP and the far right in Britain.Â  But this backfired on 
Allen and his program cronies because what this imagery showed was the 
horrendous damage the Marxist Left educational system has done to our 
young people in Britain today.Â  Official statistics reveal that in 1959 
the proportion of young people leaving school who couldnâ€™t read or write
 properly was 3 in every 1000.Â  In the mid-1960s the Marxist Left began 
to abolish and dismantle our Grammar Schools and Secondary Modern 
Schools, and replaced them with the Leftist sausage machine of the 
â€˜Comprehensive Systemâ€™, at which point the British educational system 
began to rapidly disintegrate at an alarming rate.Â  Today, in the 
â€˜politically correctâ€™ world of the Marxist Left, the proportion of young
 people leaving school who canâ€™t read or write properly has plummeted to
 a scandalous and shocking 3 in 7!Â  That means that in less than four 
decades, our traditional educational standards have been virtually wiped
 out by the Marxist Leftâ€”all in the name of politically correct 
â€˜equalityâ€™.Â  And itâ€™s getting worse with every passing year!Â  Now that 
our young folk are all â€˜equallyâ€™ illiterate, where do they go from 
here?Â  Welfare benefits, thatâ€™s where!Â  This is what the Marxist Left 
has done to our young people and to our educational system.Â  The Marxist
 Left have destroyed the future and sense of self-respect of Britainâ€™s 
youth by making them dependant on welfare benefits for their survival 
because no one is going to employ someone who is illiterate or even 
semi-literate.Â  Today, youngsters leave school clutching qualifications 
and diplomas they canâ€™t even read.Â  Employers are continually 
complaining to Job Centres about the appalling level of illiteracy among
 young school leavers.

It never ceases to amaze me how far the 
Marxist Left will go to suppress the voice of the indigenous British 
people and ridicule and insult its critics and legitimate opponents.Â  If
 the BNP really are as bad as the Marxist Left say they are, then what 
are the Marxist Left so afraid of?Â  Surely, if the BNP really are that 
bad then no one will vote for them!Â  And if that is the case, then why 
did the British people elect Nick Griffin as an MEP?Â  It really is like 
being back in school again watching the schoolyard bully and his gang of
 like-minded thugs bullying and persecuting anyone who is not like 
them.Â  For those of you who have been bullied at school you will 
immediately recognise the symptoms.
Also, if you have often wondered 
about the reason for this hostile attitude, the answer is simple and 
right there in front of your nose: the Marxist Left have no logical or 
sensible counter-argument to present, so all they can do is ridicule, 
insult, threaten, and  down anyone who doesnâ€™t agree with them and 
then outlaw the truth.Â  The Marxist Left have created a world where 
traditional values have been turned on their head: i.e. the truth is a 
lie and the lie is the truth.

We in the BNP refuse to kow-tow to this
 Marxist dictatorship or toe the â€˜politically correctâ€™ line.Â  We donâ€™t 
care about being persecuted.Â  If we are being persecuted and hounded by 
the Marxist Left, then we must be doing something right!Â  Our own 
history has shown that for the past two thousand years the British have 
had to fight to secure their freedoms and fight those who want to take 
them away from us.Â  Today, Britain is awash with those who fear and hate
 the truth.Â  Today, Britain is awash with those who fear and hate the 
British indigenous peopleâ€”including the Leftist politicians we keep 
voting into office.Â  You donâ€™t think so?Â  Then just listen to this:Â  In 
April 2009 (and unbeknown to the British people) over 122 MPs at 
Westminster (including Labour, Conservative and Lib-Dem MPs) signed a 
clandestine declaration affirming that there was no such thing as an 
â€˜indigenousâ€™ people of Britain!Â  The reason for this is that the Marxist
 agenda in Britain is to deliberately destroy the indigenous status of 
the people and replace it with a multicultural and multiracial zoo.Â  The
 idea being that anyone coming to Britain has the â€˜rightâ€™ to stay in 
Britain and be a British citizen regardless of who he is or what he is 
or where he has come from.
Where, you may ask, did this â€˜rightâ€™ come 
from?Â  It came from the Leftist politicians themselves who sowed the 
seeds for this social catastrophe just after the Second World War, and 
to support their â€˜social engineeringâ€™ policy they draw upon the ancient 
demographic history of Britain to sponsor and maintain this â€˜rightâ€™.Â  
This wicked policy is, of course, an absolute godsend not only to 
international criminals and terrorist, but to militant Islam, who see 
this as a golden opportunity to invade and occupy Britain and Europe 
through mass immigration, asylum and burgeoning birth rates without 
having to fire a single shot!

Thus, the political and socialist 
thinking now emanating from our political elite in Westminster is that 
the white â€˜indigenousâ€™ people of Britain does not exist and that 
consequently, have no legal recognition and no ancestral, moral, or 
patriotic right or claim to their own country, and that anyone who can 
get to the shores of Britain can become a â€˜Britishâ€™ citizen merely 
through the simple expedience of coming here!Â  This insidious and evil 
declaration drawn up by these Marxist politicians is not only a 
bare-faced lie, but it also flies in the face of scientific historical 
evidence of the mitochondrial DNA of the British people, and is still of politicians secretly bent on 
the racial and cultural destruction of the Br
And remember
 this fellow patriots: The truth will Always prevail in any dictatorship
 as long as there are strong and patriotic individuals who â€”regardless of
 what the secular law says!was to an article not widely viewed, so here it is again for those that missed it.
