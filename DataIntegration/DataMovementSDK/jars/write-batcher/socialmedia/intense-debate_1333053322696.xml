But it doesn't.

The CEO of United Health care made 102 million dollars in 2009.  First quarter 2010 profit (not the entire year, but first quarter) was 1.2 billion...so lets make that 4.8 billion for a year.  That makes the CEO's compensation a little more than 2% (if the government could only limit itself to that much).

Interesting...not one CEO makes more that 170 million.  Additionally, significant portions of that compensation is in the form of stock (RSU or options) and not direct compensation (i.e. a pay check).

I find it interesting that you changed the subject from crazy profits to CEO compensation.  Which is it?

You keep building those straw men you learned in those "evil" Universities.  Facts Always Burn them down, but clearly you're too smart for facts.  You would rather spend your time building straw men and perpetrating ad hominem attacks in an attempt to cover your own ignorance. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ljdz8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tz1k</id></website><link>http://www.mediaite.com/online/listen-to-day-two-arguments-in-supreme-court-battle-over-obamacare/</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T17:19:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:55:41+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ttlq</id><link>http://www.mediaite.com/online/listen-to-day-two-arguments-in-supreme-court-battle-over-obamacare/#comment-479506195</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/y0tez</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
