I dock to switch to hype and warp to gate pounce as it jumped. I get to gate, its support warps Off o.0 and I get tackle and chewing through it as i Burn closer.
Everything starts coming back and i know im gonna die. Look away to pop a pill and SOME FUCKING HOW im now 14km from the the thing.
I manage to get tackle again and die with it in low armor.
I capped out to shit so unless its the legion with neuts I only seen the drake with a neut on me tbh.
very annoyed at this, freighter shoulda died and would have if i had noticed i was moving outta range</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yf76p</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/bhjw</id></website><link>http://poshu.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=12818289</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:02:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:13:51+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi572h</id><link>http://poshu.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=12818289#comment-473857789</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h7wha</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
