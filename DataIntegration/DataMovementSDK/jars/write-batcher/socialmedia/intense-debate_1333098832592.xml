Just like lots of jobs out there, this one pays you nothing and asks for everything. I've Always had a Burning desire to one day make it into the development side of the industry, however after seeing what the industry does to QA, my desire is almost completely gone to work in the industry at all. I've only seen a hand full of people make it in the industry through QA and for the most part it has to do with who you get to know. Maybe at some level of the industry it gets better, however I am no longer willing to take that leap of faith. I am happy to finally be out of the industry, but sad to realize the industry will step on QA so everyone else can profit.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zt292</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7d9s</id></website><link>http://games.ign.com/articles/122/1221612p1.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:03:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:19:59+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3j6hb</id><link>http://games.ign.com/articles/122/1221612p1.html#comment-479963722</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g10c6</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
