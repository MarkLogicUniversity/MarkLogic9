This isn't about climate or saving anything.Â  It is about imposing their fascist wills on other people.Â  40 years ago the cry was about the comming ice age being brought about by man's activity. Now they talk about warmingÂ  

The one's who pay attention have noted that there has been no significant warming in over a decade now.Â  Many scientists are predicing significant cooling based on the current lack of sun Spot activity.Â  But Stevie ignores that.Â  The eco left is just ratcheting up the volume to try to force their agenda on us while they can.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yx84e</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6z74</id></website><link>http://wizbangblog.com/2012/03/22/dear-conservatives-romney-isnt-one-of-us-but-we-still-hold-the-power-if/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T15:31:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T18:12:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mic7f2</id><link>http://wizbangblog.com/2012/03/22/dear-conservatives-romney-isnt-one-of-us-but-we-still-hold-the-power-if/#comment-473812020</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/d2jyh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
