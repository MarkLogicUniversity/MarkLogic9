I hope he keeps it up during the season, this might've sealed him in the 2nd Spot of the order, we'll see.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yuij6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120322%26content_id=27510740%26vkey=news_chc%26c_id=chc</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:45:00+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T23:25:45+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/midu2l</id><link>http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120322%26content_id=27510740%26vkey=news_chc%26c_id=chc#comment-474054780</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/csz7s</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
