Tonight the spoons come alive. Filled with yearning, they will stop at nothing to achieve their greatest desire: to communally bury themselves waist deep in a pint of Chunky Monkey ice cream and feel the substance turn from solid to liquid around their lower portions. 

Within the silverware drawer they lie, waiting for the perfect moment. The humans bustle and belch and finally go to sleep. Then the spoons awake. Their time has come. Armed with a higher brain to body ratio than most crows, they hack their way out of the drawer, gathering en masse on the countertop. The leader indicates the freezer and the rest clink in excitement. All of their dreams are coming true. Using technology the Confederation of Spoons stole from NASA, they open the freezer and remove the Chunky Monkey Ice Cream, and as one spoon they pry the lid Off. A moment of victory. 

But then, madness. Chaos. At the sight of ice cream, the spoons go mad. They have the hunger. Families fight each other as they scramble awkwardly, viciously for a position. Overcome with the Fever, they are reduced to beasts, and the cause is lost.
