I, myself will  view  as the most arrogant individual to ever play the game. Case in point, has anyone wondered where the video of 's Academy award performance where he danced in alleged Back pain last Wednesday after the photographer flashed him during his backswing? The video has been removed on every media including the golf channel.
Tell me why not a single comment about its disappearance? Why? because  still wants to manipulate what's disseminated about him. The video, for those who were fortunate to have seen it before it was pulled was simply hilarious and typical of the drama queen that is Tiger Woods.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rbwpo</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/9dd2</id></website><link>http://www.golfchannel.com/news/jason-sobel/opening-the-floodgates/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T03:16:26+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T17:15:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/ms3g3s</id><link>http://www.golfchannel.com/news/jason-sobel/opening-the-floodgates/#comment-478558292</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zh6pj</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
