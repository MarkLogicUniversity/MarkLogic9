I cannot quantify or put into words the frustration and anger I feel as a result of their poor customer service. This is the most frustrating experience Iâ€™ve had outside of dealing with trains in China. I am seriously contemplating never using Amazon again after my Prime membership expires. It is really not worth this Headache when I attempt to get some sort of recourse as a consumer. I donâ€™t understand how you expect to keep customers with such poor customer service.Imagine this situation. I signed up for JungleDisk in 2008. I bought a lifetime subscription. I started using in February for a computer I was going to send to get fixed and I was afraid might would get wiped. I backed up my data and everything was all dandy. My laptop came back and promptly the harddrive died. I clearly have not used that laptop for three months. In that time, I clearly did not upload/download anything (no traffic). I forgot to cancel. That was fine. I attempted to cancel this past week. I went on the Jungledisk website and kept on clicking on links trying to find out how to cancel. I ended up having to google â€œcancel Junglediskâ€&#157; and came to this page:Â http://support.jungledisk.com/entries/19059-closing-your-account. I attempted to implement both steps. Since I wasnâ€™t clear where my files were stored I clicked on both links in the second step. Somehow I ended up at a page asking me for my credit card authorization. I stupidly clicked Yes thinking that it would solve my problems and boom instead I had somehow ended up paying for more even though I wanted to cancel. This was not due to the persuasiveness of this website. It is due to their confusing, misleading and misdirecting website that completely frustrates anyone who wishes to cancel their clearly unreliable service. Unreliable not just in customer service but also in being a reliable back-up solution. I got really frustrated because somehow I was not able to cancel. I couldnâ€™t go to my laptop and try to remove all my data because my laptop had crashed. So I tried to find a Jungledisk customer service number. Did not find one. I wrote them asking to cancel. They said sorry I wished to cancel and said that they had canceled my lifetime subscription. Thatâ€™s another thing I donâ€™t understand. If I had a lifetime subscription why was I paying $3 a month to them? Regardless, then I called Amazon and was told that Amazon Web Services Support was not available. I wrote an email. They responded promptly and said that my service had been canceled and that I might incur some extra usage costs for the half-duration of the month until I decided to cancel. I naively thought the issue had been Resolved.Then yesterday I received a charge to my bank account for $4.57. I donâ€™t understand why I was charged the $3 when I had a lifetime subscription and I was told that even that was canceled. I also donâ€™t understand why I was charged the extra $1.57 when clearly I did not use â€“ upload/download whatever â€“ any data because my computer harddrive crashed.I am so frustrated that 1) the website does not clearly show how to cancel and is intentionally misleading to people who want to cancel and 2) customer service assured me that they had solved the problem and then I was somehow charged again. These factors together suggest that their customer service either lied to me or is inept, and I shouldnâ€™t suffer because of that. This is bordering on fraud because it is clearly misleading to the consumer and then they charged me without my permission.Should've read the reviews below. Clearly these people are intent on defrauding unsuspecting customers.
