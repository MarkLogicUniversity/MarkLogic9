Â  Most have been involved with drugs, selling mostly, but using as well, as an easy way to forge a Â living after having 'dropped out.' Â Of everything....school, etc. Â Common thread: Â Hopeless or erratic home environment (not ), an interrupted education and low self esteem that convinces them they'll never find a decent jobs that can support them. Â It really is JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. Â I see it as a total failure of government. Â No jobs that can be a made available to this segment of our society should EVER be sent overseas. Â Perhaps Obama is correct...the ATM's did it? Â  Â YOU will Always have a job as long as young men have no hope of doing what they are hard-wired for....supporting a family.
