Her father started to rape her around this age as well. He didn't stop until she got her period, and only stopped because he "didn't want to risk her getting pregnant." *Vomit* She finally got the courage at 17 to tell someone and took her dad to court. He's currently serving time for, I think, 176 counts of some kind of fancy term for child rape. I just hope for this girl's sake she isn't plastered all over the media like my friend was. She made front page news in several cities featuring her story. These girls are so strong and brave for finally speaking out against their abusers. I'm Glad they both have lots of family support. Hopefully this young lady will be able to overcome it like my friend did. "K" is now married and has two beautiful little boys. She was also able to be adopted by her very recent step-father and change her maiden name to his. :)
