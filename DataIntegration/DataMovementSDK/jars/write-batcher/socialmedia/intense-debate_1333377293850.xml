We've had  Corruption and lies, manifestos that you may as well Burn on a bonfire!  Politicians Gain power by false pretences and when they have that power - they abuse it!  I say this to everyone who values this country's past and more importantly its future.   We are slipping into a totalitarian state.  Many thought it couldn't happen here - but it is now becoming a reality!  If you support the traditional parties from now on then you'll deserve everything you get!  Its starring us in the face, it's everywhere you go, Britain is NOT the same country it was 20 years ago!
