That would make him heavily biased in some peoples books.

It is hard to imagine a scam scenario. Â Rossi has not sold shares which would be the "logical scam". Â He has also moved to the U.S. where scam laws are more far Reaching and stringent. Â He has also been working on this for 6 years now when in all honesty he is worth a six figure salary with his knowledge and work history and patents he owns. Â He was not poor to begin with. Â Could you afford to work on a pet project for 6 years with no pay?

Anyways it is actually 16 entities claiming excess Heat with Ni-H. Â There is 4 that claim to be able to control LENR. Â  LENR using non Ni-H reactions have been confirmed by hundreds of experiments worldwide. Â LENR is not the question. Â It is the ability to control LENR at temperatures high enough for commercialization.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zgwpu</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/1ld</id></website><link>http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/03/brillioun-energy-closing-to.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T08:05:40+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:49:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwzsqr</id><link>http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/03/brillioun-energy-closing-to.html#comment-481065527</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lxu6q</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
