They associate some of us with a little more personality than others as being "too black" or what is it they call it, oh yeah, "ghetto". I know how to conduct myself in a respectful manner as well. But I feel like thats just part of our culture. Whether its in church, or at Old School BBQ Spot Off 6th street. I don't think we should change who we are around them, but were the ones more at risk for be judged for whatever we do. I also  feel like sometimes people in our own community can be our worst enemies when it comes to topics like this. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lxvxb</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/uf8t</id></website><link>http://madamenoire.com/150493/madame-on-the-street-do-you-change-your-behavior-when-youre-around-white-people/</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T12:50:23+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:14:05+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m338lw</id><link>http://madamenoire.com/150493/madame-on-the-street-do-you-change-your-behavior-when-youre-around-white-people/#comment-480233266</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
