However,Â  I also understand why he (almost certainly terminal) would rather throw caution to the wind &amp; strike forth; be daring. 
LIVE however long he has in his own way, on his own terms. 
Maybe there will be bad moments... but he also might be lucky enough to have enough moments of wonder and Joy and happiness to make the rest less horrible. 
Hard as it is, try to appreciate that for him. 
Even harder, try your best not to coddle him or tsk,tsk him. 
Help him celebrate as much as possible because, the truth is, he knows better than anyone (even you) the reality of his situation. 
If I were in his position, I think I might also want to 'burn out rather than fade away.'

Tight Hugs, Venom
