Hopefully it will go some way to quieting the Season 3 haters somewhat. Not that Iâ€™m advocating anyone bluntening (sickening sic) their critical faculties in the service of showing respect and love for their favourite things, but it really bothers me that the moment Rush starts canoodling with delicious, sumptuous synths the prog â€œtraditionalistsâ€&#157; are out the window. Canâ€™t fans of Communinty just accept that their happy place show is an organic entity and will never conform to anyoneâ€™s idealised version of it? You got your Season 1 pushers, and your Season 2 tifosi and they all bemoan the steady decline of the show since Harmon and Ganz and the rest of the writers touched their particular soft Spot. The truth is that what sets Community apart from the rest of TV land is they theyâ€™re Always trying, never settling for one particular mode or tone, and I respect that. Stop bitching and try to find the positives, of which there have been plenty this season, instead of trumpeting what you hate. Itâ€™s called being measured. Try and enjoy and appreciate this weird and wonderful little carnival while it is on, before NBC too regressed into Modern Family and Two Broke Girl mode.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z9yyj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/digital-exploration-of-interior-design,71200/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:30:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:30:10+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ktrb</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/digital-exploration-of-interior-design,71200/#comment-480159346</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zrw2e</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
