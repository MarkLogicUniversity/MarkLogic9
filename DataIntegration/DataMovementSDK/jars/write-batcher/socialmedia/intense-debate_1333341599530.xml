When are the Bleeding heart liberals going to realise this will all go very badly wrong? Syria was a tolerant society, ok not as tolerant as the "West", but atleast people of different religions lived next to each other. Now look at Egypt, Lybia, Tunisia, Algeria, etc, if you're not muslim you're not welcome. So criminals got roughed up in prison by the police, what, would you rather women got stoned to death because they were raped?

Yes Assad has his bad points, but what you will get in his place with the rebels is the Taliban.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/673jpk</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9177910/Syria-eyewitness-dispatch-I-watched-as-President-Bashar-al-Assads-tanks-destroyed-a-rebel-town.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T17:03:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T17:58:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw00g5</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9177910/Syria-eyewitness-dispatch-I-watched-as-President-Bashar-al-Assads-tanks-destroyed-a-rebel-town.html#comment-482048680</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6wanh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
