Anderson pulls into the premier's parking Spot.  Whether he actually knew it was or not is irrelevant.  The Sheriff sees him doing it, and not knowing or caring who he was, commenced to chew him out for it in a rather non diplomatic manner.  Anderson gets on the defensive and pulls rank.  Did he threaten speak to her supervisor about her conduct and her job?  Yeah, probably.  And he probably did lose his composure a little, but I don't think that happened for no reason.  I think if anyone else here was in the same situation as Anderson, and had some cop jump all over them right Off the bat for something as trivial as a parking matter, they would have probably reacted in the same way.  And anyone here that says differently is a liar. 

But to me, this whole incident, from what I gather after reading all the news reports, basically amounted to a 'pissing contest' between the Sheriff and Mr. Anderson.  And it ended up giving the Government some ammo to use against their competition.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ye7fp</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7maa</id></website><link>http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/03/21/he-took-the-preems-place</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T01:44:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T23:51:24+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/midw46</id><link>http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/03/21/he-took-the-preems-place#comment-474069682</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/d5e68</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
