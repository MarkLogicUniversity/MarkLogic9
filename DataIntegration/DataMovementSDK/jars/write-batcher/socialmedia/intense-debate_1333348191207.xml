I knowÂ that stability control isÂ a legal requirement now and a well calibrated one will save lives, but where are the standards to differentiate between the good and the bad.
The Chinese now put them in their cars for our market, but I would never really trust it.
The main advantage of the Hyundai (other than the relative price) over the Kluger is that it is a diesel, and pretty good one at that. Economy and crusing is pretty good but the copious torque does cause the same problems on-road reported -road.
The Kluger advantages over the Santa is its larger interior and Comfort.
It too suffers from torque steer and stability control issues, but not quite as bad as the Santa Fe because it's petrol engine, while good, produces less torque.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vs8np</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/drfv</id></website><link>http://www.carpoint.com.au/reviews/2012/medium-4x4/hyundai/santa-fe/hyundai-santa-fe-long-term-update-29532</link><postedTime>2012-04-02T03:21:13+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T06:11:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0j2nc</id><link>http://www.carpoint.com.au/reviews/2012/medium-4x4/hyundai/santa-fe/hyundai-santa-fe-long-term-update-29532#comment-483310227</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
