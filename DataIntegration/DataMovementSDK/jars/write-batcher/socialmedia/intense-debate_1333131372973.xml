This is the dumbest story ever.  And why would you not want redheads?  They are already becoming rare.   Though she wasn't born red, my favorite is still Rita Hayworth.   Nothing better that seeing a tall leggy redhead go by....you don't want to be operating a motor vehicle when that occurs.

My mother was a red head (auburn, really) with emerald green eye's.  My dad an Italian with bblack hair and eyes...me, brown with red caste and hazel eyes...my wife, Irish with bblack hair and blazing blue eyes.  My kids were blondish with hazel eyes like me.  Finally!  A ginger grand daughter with blue eye's and Faint, cute freckles splashed across her nose as we all had, probably from my mom. And she's beautiful!   As is the other grand daughter with bblack hair and bblack eyes like my dad....but it was a long wait!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/e3nvsg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/09/19/worlds-biggest-sperm-bank-turning-away-redheads/</link><postedTime>2011-09-19T13:56:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-09-19T19:31:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/gmbu1i</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/09/19/worlds-biggest-sperm-bank-turning-away-redheads/#comment-315145326</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8nldh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-09-19</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
