Romneycare and Obamacare may or may not be different but they are similar enough for the 30 second ad Spots the dem machine will roll and roll with each time republicans bring it up, maybe Romneycare is better  doesn't matter 30 second Spots will already be running and running and running . those ads will reinforce that flip flop image Romney has  struggled with, Mitt is not popular with the base in his party as the results show. It'ss not like Newt or Santorum set  voters on fire. Turnout is way down in their primaries. 

At least Mitt like Obama tried to deal with the health care problem where it has Always been the norm for any American with a pre existing condition to be denied health insurance coverage in the best health care system in the world some like to call it. More than  anyone can say for all the critics.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67i5jd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6tdd</id></website><link>http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/President/2012/0331/Presidential-race-has-become-two-man-Romney-versus-Obama</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:48:19+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T16:56:34+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwwpby</id><link>http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/President/2012/0331/Presidential-race-has-become-two-man-Romney-versus-Obama#comment-481994865</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/r4rc0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
