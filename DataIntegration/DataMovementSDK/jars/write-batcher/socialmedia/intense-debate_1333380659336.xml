It relieves everything from post traumatic stress syndrome, to MS, to Nausea, etc.  and it has a side effect of euphoria...wow it makes people feel GOOD while helping to heal.  In comparison, the FDA keeps drugs like CIPRO legal!Â  And how many a year die from Tylenol?Â  What a system.
 
If you still believe marijuana isn't safe please take a moment to check, look up if there are any over doses, any deaths...in the last 6,000 years...or EVER! Â  See what it does and how it helps those with with MS and other ailments...and without harmful negative side effects.
 
One last thought, what would happen if the drug dealers lost their market?  Marijuana is a plant its NOT a gateway drug...unless you make people go to a dealer to get it.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/mfcpud</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/h98u</id></website><link>http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2011/11/show_me_weed_mo_may_vote_on_marijuana_legalization.php</link><postedTime>2011-11-08T17:16:28+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-01-04T14:07:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/eblwh1</id><link>http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2011/11/show_me_weed_mo_may_vote_on_marijuana_legalization.php#comment-400353036</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-11-08</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
