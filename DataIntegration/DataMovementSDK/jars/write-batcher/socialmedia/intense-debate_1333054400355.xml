And the second reason? Look at the first reason. When blacks do not get their way, their animal instincts kicks in, they cannot be civilized as a group, their  are to work themselves into a frenzy and attack whatever is within their immediate vicinity. Hence, all the Burned cars, buildings destroyed, stores being robbed (see flash mobs) mass thievery, etc etc etc, and the sad part is, there was nothing done to the majority of these individuals for then to even provoke them into carrying out these evil deeds.

If you will also notice, take any well educated black person that speaks the English language appropriately,  put them in a group of street brothas, and in a matter of minutes, the R's and Esses will be profound as they lose all sense of their learning, it is their animal instinct, they Always revert back to it. That is their culture.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zclg5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/second-trayvon-martin-twitter-feed-identified/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:00:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T12:21:52+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3vy20</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/second-trayvon-martin-twitter-feed-identified/#comment-479448755</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
