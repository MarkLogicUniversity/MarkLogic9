Noses can break without severe Bleeding. And, Mr. ER Dr., you should know that blood is a fluid that does not necessarily get on clothes, anymore than any other fluid. Clothes are not a magnet for blood. If blood on clothing was a requisite of having a broken nose, then that's the first thing you guys would check... does he have a bloody shirt? NO? His nose is fine. A towel covered in blood? What about his shirt? If his shirt is dry, his nose is fine. When an ENT does corrective surgery, do they throw away the patient's shirt? I broke my nose twice, it didn't Bleed either time. I'm sure all the "nose must Bleed" conspiracy theorists will dispute my account, but I assure you, broken bones do not Always discharge blood on the outside of one's body!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6za97r</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/police-surveillance-video-of-zimmerman-may-show-head-injury/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T08:19:40+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:35:31+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3puy9</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/police-surveillance-video-of-zimmerman-may-show-head-injury/#comment-480073742</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/m8r5x</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
