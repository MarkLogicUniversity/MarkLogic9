Yes they have. 
Copts have been frwequently treated abominably in history. 1 million Armenians were killed through Cold, Thirst and starvation (women were raped too). 
Spreading the net a little: 2 million non-Muslim Sudanese killed by the Muslim North. Atrocities committed by Indian Moghul rulers and Muslim invaders. 
Unfortunately, we are only too aware of modern Islamic fanaticism too: 9/11, 7/7, Madrid, Luxor, Toulouse. Again the list goes on and on, to well over 10,000 events just since 9/11. 
 
&amp;quot;he Communists ...  on the Christians in lieu thereof&amp;rdquo;.  
The Jizya is designed to impoverish its victims (so say Islamic Authorities both ancient and modern) and &amp;quot;high office&amp;quot; is explicitly Banned for non-Muslims who aren&amp;#039;t allowed (Islamically sopeaking) to &amp;quot;rule &amp;quot; over non-Muslims. (That Darura required the use of Jews and Xtians as a civil service on many occasions within the Dar ul Islam speaks more of the lack of native capability than any particular freedom.) 
&amp;quot;Christians living under Islamic rule have never been subjected to any form of religious persecution&amp;quot;? See above for examples of active persecution today. Here Arnold is simply ignorant of history: for example many Copts were murdered in &amp;quot;response&amp;quot; to the crusades, but then again the killing of innocents in &amp;quot;revenge&amp;quot; is a well practised Islamic reaction to this day.  
Of course the Muslim definition of &amp;quot;persecution&amp;quot; is anything that prevents one living a completely Islamic lifestyle, so on those grounds non-Muslims wouldn&amp;#039;t be &amp;quot;persecuted&amp;quot; even if rpaed, enslaved, killed etc. since these are mandated by Islam.
