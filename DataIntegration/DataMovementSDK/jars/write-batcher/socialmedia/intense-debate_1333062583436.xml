I am sure there are some idiots that go overboard but as far as AMI is concerned they do a very good job administering the covenants. Suggest before you buy a home in a sub that has HOA that you read and understand the rules. If it says no motor homes can be parked in the driveway for more than 2 weeks at a time..then that is what it means. It the covenants say no roosters or chickens as pets then duh.. this is what it means. HOA help to keep a subdivision in good orderÂ protecting your investment. If you move in to my sub and you trash your front lawn..let it Burn up with no irrigation, and never rake or clean up..then yes you will receive a letter and a warning. If you do not comply and then wonder why your neighbors are ticked Off with you, then maybe you should buy a home in a sub where no one cares about the value of their home and the HOA is not active.Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zchhq</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnm5</id></website><link>http://www.idahostatesman.com/2012/03/29/2054991/a-chicken-in-every-lot.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:02:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:45:52+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3qrby</id><link>http://www.idahostatesman.com/2012/03/29/2054991/a-chicken-in-every-lot.html#comment-479592081</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g6ygc</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
