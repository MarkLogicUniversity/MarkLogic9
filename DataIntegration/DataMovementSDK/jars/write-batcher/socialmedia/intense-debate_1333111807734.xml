The ability of the nouveau regime to utterly delude itself about 
declining trajectories of events - and hence also the proper 
characterization of its own collective behavior as 'looting' or 
'fiddling while Rome Burns' - would be dumbfounding were it not 
essentially characteristic of virtually every nearly-exhausted, 
over-leveraged power aggregate and ruling class in history. To such an 
extent, it almost seems now, that we could learn to forecast the fall of
 great powers by observation of their own diminishing capacity to 
maintain long-Scope control over events.
