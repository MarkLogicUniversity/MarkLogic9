In Artful Dodger style, Barack Obama, plays down his mentorship with Communist author Saul Alinsky.  But Alinskyâ€™s son, L. David Alinsky, credits Obama for â€œlearning his lesson wellâ€&#157; from the Communist guru.

Indeed, Alinsky Jr. who credits his late father for the success of last weekâ€™s Democratic National Convention, may have done something that Obamaâ€™s detractors couldnâ€™t: blown the cover on the presidential hopefulâ€™s communist leanings.

No one can blame Alinsky for the pretentiousness of the Ancient Greek Temple from which Obama addressed plebes, or for the tacky neon colours on display at the  Centre, but it was Alinsky who wrote Rules for Radicals, the bible of the far left.


 
Says Alinskyâ€™s son L. David Alinsky of his fatherâ€™s influence at the Dem Convention: â€œALL the elements were present: the individual stories told by real people of their situation and hardships, the packed-to-the rafters crowd, the crowdâ€™s chanting of key phrases and names, the action on the Spot of texting and phoning to show instant support and commitment to jump into the political battle, the rallying selections of music, the setting of the agenda by the power people.â€&#157;

 â€œThe Democratic National Convention had all the elements of the perfectly organized event, Saul Alinsky style, the Communist guruâ€™s son wrote in a letter published yesterday in the Boston Globe.

The Artful Dodger may be less than pleased that he has been pegged as a Saul Alinsky Poster Boy by the guruâ€™s own son.

â€œBarack Obamaâ€™s training in Chicago by the great community organizers is showing its effectiveness,â€&#157; Alinsky Jr. wrote to the Globe.  â€œIt is an amazingly powerful format, and the method of my late father Always works to get the message out and get the supporters on board.  When executed meticulously and thoughtfully, it is a powerful strategy for initiating change and making it really happen.  Obama learned his lesson well.

â€œI am proud to see that my fatherâ€™s model for organizing is being applied successfully beyond local community organizing to affect the Democratic campaign in 2008.  It is a fine tribute to Saul Alinsky as we approach his 100th birthday.â€&#157;
