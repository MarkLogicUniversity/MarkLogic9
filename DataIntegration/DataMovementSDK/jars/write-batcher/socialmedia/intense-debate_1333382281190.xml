You are--you're a follower of the con artist Suzuki, who by the way, has financial ties to the TIDES corporation and Soros. And that he purposely ignored a large oil spill on the Yellow River over a year ago at the behest of China. Just like Gore, he seemingly ignores the massive pollution caused by the coal fire plants in California. And why? Because he receives $$$$$$$ from a foreign power. 

But all is not lost as Revenue Canada starts coming down on people like Suzuki. 
This clown who even tried to use sick advertising to get kids to send him money at Christmas.Â
