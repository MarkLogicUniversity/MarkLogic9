Gray and Kleiza did not match up well against Miami. Amir should have started this game against Anthony, and Kleiza remains an enigma -- a significant factor one night, and invisible or worse the next. JJ is probably the only one big enough and fast enough to cover James. 

At the beginning of the fourth, Casey looked around as if he was missing someone...A guy in the front row chimed in....He's with the Pacers, Dwayne....

Early in the fourth, Calderon got bashed in the face by Wade....Calderon got the foul and a technical to boot....Down at the other end, JJ bashed Wade in the face and JJ got the foul....The Heat promptly reeled Off about 8 points in a row and the game was gone....Not even the refs respect the Raptors....
