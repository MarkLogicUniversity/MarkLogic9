Doesn&amp;#039;t this give credence to this remark of his which was never reported widely in the media. (And Commentary, you were way too easy on Obama during the campaign. Everything you&amp;#039;ve learned about him since was readily available to those who wanted to know the truth.) 
 
How Barack Obama learned to love Israel 
Ali Abunimah The Electronic Intifada 4 March 2007  
&amp;quot;The last time I spoke to Obama was in the winter of 2004 at a gathering in Chicago&amp;rsquo;s Hyde Park neighborhood. He was in the midst of a primary campaign to secure the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate seat he now occupies. But at that time polls showed him trailing. 
 
As he came in from the Cold and took Off his coat, I went up to greet him. He responded warmly, and volunteered, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I haven&amp;rsquo;t said more about Palestine right now, but we are in a tough primary race. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping when things calm down I can be more up front.&amp;rdquo; He referred to my activism, including columns I was contributing to the The Chicago Tribune critical of Israeli and US policy, &amp;ldquo;Keep up the good work!&amp;rdquo;
