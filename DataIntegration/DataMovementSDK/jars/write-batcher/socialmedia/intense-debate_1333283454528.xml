LOVE ALWAYS your friend Lisa Simpson and Family</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zc070</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mbd4</id></website><link>http://www.newburyportnews.com/archive/x1437242541/William-W-Hawkins-56</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:41:33+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:29:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m39yp3</id><link>http://www.newburyportnews.com/archive/x1437242541/William-W-Hawkins-56#comment-479916357</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zz4ef</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
