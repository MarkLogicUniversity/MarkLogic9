I suppose some docs are better about the application process, like applying , telling the parents this is a caustic substance, keep it Off of her skin and properly dressing it - all things our doc didn't do. He was so fired after giving my kid a chemical Burn, thanks to him I had CPS called out to the ER because they thought we had given her a chemical Burn - so frustrating!

But if I had to do it all over again, I'd skip the silver nitrate and go straight to treating it with salt at home, worked like a charm! I would say changing the dressing twice a day isn't nearly enough, change the salt dressings whenever you notice it's wet - salt can only absorb so much moisture at once and the treatment works faster if you keep reapplying dry salt. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/da3jfq</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/qybr</id></website><link>http://www.kidsdr.com/node/834</link><postedTime>2011-11-29T03:20:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T21:25:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw4gf2</id><link>http://www.kidsdr.com/node/834#comment-481217364</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hs1zz</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-11-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
