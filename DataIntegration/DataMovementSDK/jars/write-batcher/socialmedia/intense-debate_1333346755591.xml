You're basing this Off of 50 at-bats in Spring Training. Why do those matter? Why are we only basing the decision on those at-bats?

Jones has a career .838 OPS against right handers in 1010 major league at-bats. So why do we ignore what he's done in the past three major league seasons, and just focus on the most recent numbers?

It would be absurd to suggest this at any point in the season. No one would suggest making a change if a guy has two bad weeks in June. And that's pretty much the equivalent of Spring Training. Overall it's two weeks worth of numbers.

I think you're doing more to reward effort by focusing on what a player has done in his career, rather than focusing on a small sample of Spring numbers. I also think that a "what have you done for me lately" approach makes a player feel more unappreciated than sending a player down after 40-50 good at-bats in Spring Training.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67xdj2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ymk5</id></website><link>http://blogs.piratesprospects.com/williams/first-pitch-when-to-free-matt-hague/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T04:00:42+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T19:19:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0a7oq</id><link>http://blogs.piratesprospects.com/williams/first-pitch-when-to-free-matt-hague/#comment-482116915</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8yfh1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
