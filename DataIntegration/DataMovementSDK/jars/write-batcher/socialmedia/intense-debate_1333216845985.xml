Earlier this week, Glenn Kessler, author of The Washington Post's Fact Checker column, took issue with the following Democratic National Committee ad accusing Mitt Romney of flip-flopping on his support for requiring people to buy health insurance:

Mitt Romney: Against Individual Mandates Except When He's For Them

Kessler says the accusation doesn't fly:

    "Romney has been consistent in saying that he would apply a state-based approach to health care. He has said the individual mandate worked well for Massachusetts, he may have even predicted that most other states would eventually adopt it, but he has never advocated or supported a federal mandate â€” as contained in the presidentâ€™s law."

&lt;strong&gt;Romney may not have ever said "I support a federal mandate to purchase health insurance" in so many words, but if you look at his record, it's hard to conclude that he did not support copying the Massachusetts plan at the federal level, including the mandateâ€”which is essentially what Democrats did with ObamaCare. &lt;/strong&gt;

As Kessler notes, Romney has repeatedly stated his belief that the Massachusetts plan should be a model for the nation. Sometimes he has said that the plan can provide lessons for other states. But at other times, he has recommended that Washington's leaders, including President Obama, follow the Bay State's lead. As Matt Welch previously noted, in a 2009 USA Today op-ed framed as a message to the president (title: "Mr. President, What's the Rush?"), Romney criticized the legislative process of previous Obama administration priorities and declared: "Thereâ€™s a better way. And the lessons we learned in Massachusetts could help Washington find it." Among those lessons? 

&lt;strong&gt;"Our experience also demonstrates that getting every citizen insured doesnâ€™t have to break the bank. First, we established incentives for those who were uninsured to buy insurance. Using tax penalties, as we did, or tax credits, as others have proposed, encourages â€œfree ridersâ€&#157; to take responsibility for themselves rather than pass their medical costs on to others. This doesnâ€™t cost the government a single dollar. "

There you have it. In the summer of 2009, as the health care debate was Reaching one of its most Heated moments, Romney argued to President Obama that the federal government would be well served by adopting Massachusetts-style tax penalties for the uninsuredâ€”in other words, a mandate.&lt;/strong&gt;
