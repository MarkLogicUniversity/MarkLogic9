No reason to be talking about being a complete bust unless he's an idiot and doesn't adapt.

I think he'll be great if he can Spot the Off-speed stuff to go along.

The fatigue of going every 5 days as opposed to 6 might be visible towards the end of the season. However, he did pitch 232 innings in 28 starts. That's an average of 8.28 innings per start. So I don't really see any reason for him not to be able to go 6.5'ish innings/start with a higher WHIP over 30+ starts (barring injury of course) - ie: 200 innings or so.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67xu5z</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27774888%26vkey=news_tex%26c_id=tex</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T04:23:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T11:43:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwpia2</id><link>http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27774888%26vkey=news_tex%26c_id=tex#comment-481762116</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/yqv3d</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
