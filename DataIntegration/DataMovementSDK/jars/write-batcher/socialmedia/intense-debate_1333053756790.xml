before the end of the season, despite taking an enforced rest from his recovery 
process.

Some reports claimed the Danish goalkeeper would miss the remainder of the 
run-in with an ankle injury but Sir Alex is hopeful that Lindegaard will soon be 
able to resume his battle with David De Gea for a starting Spot.

"Anders was training very well," stated the boss on Friday. "And maybe he 
overdid it.

"We've given him a week Off, a rest period for a week, and he should be back 
before the end of the season." from the official Manchester United site".
.
We are pushing our luck though , with only 2 goal experienced goal keepers , if Lindegaard is indeed a long term injury. Although there is nothing to suggest on what we have seen that Ben Amos is not very capable in between the sticks , as the article highlights .
Reports elsewhere suggest United are monitoring the young goalkeeper at Notts County , Fabian Speis . Although City and several London clubs are also monitoring Speis.
This is where a utility man, like big John O' shea comes in handy &lt;wink &gt;
Fingers crossed nothing adverse happens to theÂ improving ,Â gameÂ  by game , David de Gea , with 8 cup finals to theÂ 20th Premiership titleÂ finishing line.Â
