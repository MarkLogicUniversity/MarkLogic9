Nothing is gong to really move until this fall. X86 tablets are PCs. They will have wireless keyboard/mouse option and run MS Office, Metro and legacy software. Both businesses and comsumers will flock to the mobile PC. The PC is alive and well. The lepoard just changed it's Spots, that's all. All this talk about the death of the PC is just hype that Apple has so skillfully exploited. The IPad is really just a dead end and they know it. There's know money in the platform if they have to slash it's price to compete. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l4f92</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rvx5</id></website><link>http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/27/technology/ultrabooks/</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T10:20:51+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T05:51:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3wzp8</id><link>http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/27/technology/ultrabooks/#comment-480296054</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/d9mtb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
