Dogturds like you would rather wait for what?Â  Until the kiIIing is being done in your front yard?  I really, truly hope you get to see something like that up close and personal someday.  You can take my word for it or not, it's not a lot of fun.  Semper Fi you wormy chunk of Vomit, and you're welcome.

And who the heII said anything about Christians anyway?  This story is about JEWS.  You are an incredibly dense piece of dogshit, aren't you?

Go back to Al-Jazeera where people want to read the idiocy you write, you stupid dickwad.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hs9ve</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/03/28/cat-and-dog-chase-interrupts-basketball-game-in-israel/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T22:59:17+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:06:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3sw76</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/03/28/cat-and-dog-chase-interrupts-basketball-game-in-israel/#comment-480228166</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cie5x</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
