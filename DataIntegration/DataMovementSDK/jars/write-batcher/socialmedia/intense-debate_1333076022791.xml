Hey, do not
worry about the Dziekanski case. As we all know all cops good and if not their
bosses are trust worthy. Therefore, Dziekanski case is an odd ball for cops who
killed him we can safely say their bosses Acted rightly. OHH wait that is wrong
the guy who took the video sent it to the RCMP first then showed it on the web.
Not a problem does not mean anything expect he had to go to court to get it
back from the RCMP. They had promised to give it back then refused after he
said he was putting it on the web. 



Be warned
when you give a cop a weapon that can be used for anything situation. 



Moreover,
for those who say that it could save a cops life bull crap! If the situation is
serious enough that the officers life is truly endangered they can use their
gun to protect themselves and most likely will. Even then, cops are to aim not
to kill but just to stop the person from hurting them by shooting in the leg or
arm not the chest. However, with a Taser they aim for the chest, why because
the father away from the suspect the more chance the prods will drift further
apart and as such if they aimed for the leg they are more than like to miss. Tasers
can be used for almost any situation from a weapon being pulled on the officer
to someone running away from the officer to avoid arrest. 



Would u like
it if it were your son, daughter, or grandchild who because they were afraid of
getting in trouble ran away from a cop so he/she shot her with this device? Â Even the best children can make mistakes. 



Would u like it if they had Burns on the skin or even
under the skin where you could not see? 



Would u like it if they had damaged blood vessels,
nerves, muscles? 



How about swollen throat or lungs? 



Or even heartbeat problems. 



Could you see your love one being fitted with a pacemaker
at under the age of 20? 



Would you like it if your daughter who was in her first
trimester lost her baby? 



Well if you are ok with your young love ones having
one/some/or all of these problems then go ahead and support Tasers because
there are medical side effect to electrical shocks even with low voltage and â€œsafeâ€&#157;
Tasers.
