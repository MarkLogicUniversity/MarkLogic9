You show a clear ignorance of history. It was the enlightenment and industrial revolution (17th-18th century) that formed the basis of modern Western society. Christianity has been around for almost 2000 years, yet "The West" was just like anywhere else until a few hundred years ago.

I understand you're likely trying to justify your hatred of Islam, but please don't fool yourself. 400 years ago people were Burned alive in the West for heresy, people were boiled in oil, people where crushed to death under a pile of rocks, people had their limbs slowly ripped Off by ropes, etc.

The West is the epitome of human civilization IMO, but that happened *in spite* of Christianity, not because of it. Your romantic illusions about historical Christianity are not based in fact. ANY Christian nation from 1,000 years ago wouldn't have been any nicer than Iran or Saudi Arabia today, actually probably much worse.Â 

I'm not anti-Christian or pro-Islam (a fairy tale is a fairy tale), I just don't think it's useful to reinvent history.
