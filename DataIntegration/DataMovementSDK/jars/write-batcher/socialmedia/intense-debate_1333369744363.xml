Outside of what fell in his lap...Leyland has done nothing but soak up the sun this spring.  Leyland will drive you nuts with his fake humbleness and old grandpa style with the players.  He thinks hes a hardass in the likes of his mentors Parcells, Larussa, and others....he is anything but.  Leyland has had a terrible spring.  My daughter could manage this team better.  He has 3 players on his team that are not major leaguers...what has he done about it outside of option the scared players down....he takes the easy way out...cut inge and do something about Jackson leading Off....get schlereth out of there even though his dad played football for the same city (denver) that leyland managed before coming to detroit.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6voour</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120401%26content_id=27805300%26notebook_id=27824046%26vkey=notebook_det%26c_id=det</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T22:51:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T08:55:39+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0om86</id><link>http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120401%26content_id=27805300%26notebook_id=27824046%26vkey=notebook_det%26c_id=det#comment-483365314</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gxqlr</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
