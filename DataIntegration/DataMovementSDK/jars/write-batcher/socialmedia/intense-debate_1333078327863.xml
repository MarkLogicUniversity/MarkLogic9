While I was in such close contact with Zimmerman, I could
observe that his back appeared to be wet and he was covered in grass, as if he
was laying on his back on the ground," Smith wrote in the police report.
"Zimmerman was also Bleeding from the nose and the back of the head."


The officers also made several attempts to revive Martin.


When police put Zimmerman in the back of the cruiser, he
said, "I was yelling for someone to help me, but no one would help
me," according to the police report.

POINT BEING: Martin was beating Zimmerman 


"ON TOP OF HIM AND ZIMMERMAN WAS SCREAMING FOR
HELP" 


Martin was trying to put the guy in the hospital for
following him. 


That's not what a "nice kid" does..
