What a town. They sure do give an 11-year old CHILD a lot of credit. Sure, she wasn't dressing 'that way' because she is not receiving the love and respect she needs, and she lives in a culture that makes thongs for 8-year-old children and tells her she should look hot and 20 to be loved. No, it was because this 11-year-old CHILD wanted to get a bunch of local boys and MEN in trouble. I'm sure this 11-year-old CHILD made an informed, rational and mature decision when she 'put herself in this predicament.' But, maybe those young MEN only meant to rape her clothes, and not the 11-year-old CHILD wearing them? I wonder how mature the women are in this 'community', the ones who saw her and turned a blind eye while their sons and husbands went after this CHILD. As for the NYT, if it Bleeds it leads, right guys?  How much money did you make Off her story? Will you send any of it to her?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/5ytzu5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zmtw</id></website><link>http://dev.front.moveon.org:12800/the-convoluted-story-of-an-11-year-old-gang-raped-in-cleveland-texas/</link><postedTime>2011-03-19T01:08:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-03-19T15:57:20+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/8ogybr</id><link>http://dev.front.moveon.org:12800/the-convoluted-story-of-an-11-year-old-gang-raped-in-cleveland-texas/#comment-168207347</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5ss6u</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-03-19</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
