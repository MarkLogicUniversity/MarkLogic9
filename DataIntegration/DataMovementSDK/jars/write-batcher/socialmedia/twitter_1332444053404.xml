Trayvon was not a criminal, was not involved in any criminal activity yet George Zimmerman shot him in Cold blood even after Mr Zimmerman was told to back  by police dispatch. But even this is not the cause of the outrage, the fact that nothing had been done by the Sanford Police Department to investigate the death of the teenager and had simply taken the word of the shooter that he  in self-defense even though witnesses have come forward and have claimed that it was not in self-defense, this is what makes this case so outrages. An innocent black child gunned down by a white man and the white police force will not investigate. There is simply no reason for the police to take the hands Off stance.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:28381:127055174</id><idPostId>127055174</idPostId><idBlogId>28381</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:28381</id><idBlogId>28381</idBlogId><link>http://www.komonews.com</link><displayName>KOMO - Seattle, WA</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.komonews.com/news/national/-Thousands-expected-at-rally-for-slain-Fla-teen-143852116.html</link><displayName>Thousands expected at rally for slain Fla. teen | National &amp; World News | Seattle News, Weather, Spo</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:19:41.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:28381:127055174:322141013</id><inReplyTo><link>http://www.komonews.com/news/national/-Thousands-expected-at-rally-for-slain-Fla-teen-143852116.html#IDComment322120527</link></inReplyTo><link>http://www.komonews.com/news/national/-Thousands-expected-at-rally-for-slain-Fla-teen-143852116.html#IDComment322141013</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:19:41.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Thousands expected at rally for slain Fla. teen | National &amp; World News | Seattle News, Weather, Spo by Dem Dude</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://intensedebate.com/people/Wade_Boyd</link><idEmailMd5>28efc584c679330516983a07f5839b06</idEmailMd5><displayName>Dem Dude</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/people/Wade_Boyd"&gt;Dem Dude&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/national/-Thousands-expected-at-rally-for-slain-Fla-teen-143852116.html"&gt;Thousands expected at rally for slain Fla. teen | National &amp; World News | Seattle News, Weather, Spo&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
