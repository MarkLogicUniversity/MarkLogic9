Trampolines are dangerous, and the injury to Brian Sternberg is a good example of that, but they are also a lot of fun. If Joba wants to be a "Great Dad" he should be showing his son how to use a trampoline safely, not by Acting goofy and scaring his son. Just think about how much his son must have been traumatized seeing JobaÂ with a bone sticking out of his skin and Bleeding so much he almost died from loss of blood.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hcrn0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120328%26content_id=27687266%26vkey=news_mlb%26c_id=mlb</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T04:25:21+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:59:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3qn8w</id><link>http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120328%26content_id=27687266%26vkey=news_mlb%26c_id=mlb#comment-479603050</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g23id</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
