Â If you are caught smoking anywhere in public 3 times you go straight to San Quentin for life. Â If they are cigars you get the Chair. If you're a woman you go to Tehachapi. Â If you're a congressional representative you can smoke with the Governor in his special cigar room. Â 
By the way congratulations theseaoon for continuing the great tradition of Puritanical emigrants to the Land of the Free. Â Perhaps we could send you some more like-minded spirits? Â We seem to have something of a surfeit of sanctimonious souls back in Blighty. Â Of course we used to Burn them but that has now been Banned on Health and Safety grounds.
