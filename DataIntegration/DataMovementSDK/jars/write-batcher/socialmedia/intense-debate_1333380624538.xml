Sure, there were some slips and ticks and it wasn't perfection. With that said, the  was Spot on and the characters were compelling. This reminds me of Twin Peaks and who killed Laura Palmer, something fans didn't find out about until the movie. SO, I will take this series and enjoy the slow Burn and watch some excellent Acting in the process.  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vkm7h</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/vh3p</id></website><link>http://watching-tv.ew.com/2012/04/01/the-killing-amc-season-premiere-review-video/</link><postedTime>2012-04-02T02:09:25+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T10:52:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0pre7</id><link>http://watching-tv.ew.com/2012/04/01/the-killing-amc-season-premiere-review-video/#comment-483417303</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
