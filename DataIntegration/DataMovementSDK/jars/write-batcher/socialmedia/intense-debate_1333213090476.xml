Some years ago I heard Mr Galloway. On a bitterly Cold November evening he spoke to a packed Hall. The number of muslims there was in proportion to their numbers in the town. The man is the best speaker and debater we have had in public life for well over 50 years. That's the reason for his success. It's pathetic that our political class regards these skills as being obsolete these days.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/672a2z</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ms5i</id></website><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100148228/george-galloway-and-the-rise-of-sectarian-politics/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T09:35:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:06:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwvqws</id><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100148228/george-galloway-and-the-rise-of-sectarian-politics/#comment-481142552</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8x6jc</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
