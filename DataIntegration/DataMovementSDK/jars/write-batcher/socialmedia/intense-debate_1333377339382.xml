The current planting material of Jatropha has not been genetically evolved or bred either for higher productivity or adaptability to drought or pest resistance. The ratio of male to female flowers fluctuates very much with changes in temperature. Current planting material whether it is of seed or of vegetative nature can't offer consistently sustainable levels of productivity. A few months ago, FAO of UN have advised the developing countries not to waste their resources on Jatropha. Australia has virtually Banned Jatropha due to its toxicity which poses danger to human and animal health. A major research input is needed to enhance the yield performance and adaptability of Â Jatropha.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6519wq</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/oama</id></website><link>http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-15/jatropha-a-green-fuel-awash-in-red-ink</link><postedTime>2012-03-15T22:08:53+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T10:22:33+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0p2gt</id><link>http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-15/jatropha-a-green-fuel-awash-in-red-ink#comment-483403013</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zt2qe</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-15</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
