In the process, great harm is inflicted on those who managed to be good stewards of their lands - in some cases for many generations.Â  The excuse of pocket gophers, oak trees, Spotted owls, etc - they are just nice window dressing for those who justify harming their neighbors for their own agendas.Â  Unintended consequences Always follow these actions - and those who enjoy inflicting them on the rest of us - they never have to say they are sorry.Â  After all - they meant well.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rf021</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnms</id></website><link>http://www.theolympian.com/2012/03/26/2045024/in-ways-of-nature-no-magic-bullets.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T07:11:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:56:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkp81i</id><link>http://www.theolympian.com/2012/03/26/2045024/in-ways-of-nature-no-magic-bullets.html#comment-476687838</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/62emi</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
