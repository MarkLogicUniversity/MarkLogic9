You are saying when an ambulance pulls up to an accident and one car contains a poor family with no insurance, we should just let them Bleed out... because they don't have the money. SOL, as you put it. We just send them home? Allow them a phone call to see if a family member can come pick them up Off the side of the road? And if they die, well, I guess they should have bought insurance instead of gasoline. 

I don't want to live in your harsh reality. I'll pay the tax if it means the hospital will take care of the poor people too.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/674ur4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/politics/scotus-health-care-whats-next/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:33:24+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:49:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwuhrn</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/politics/scotus-health-care-whats-next/index.html#comment-481460528</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/go14k</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
