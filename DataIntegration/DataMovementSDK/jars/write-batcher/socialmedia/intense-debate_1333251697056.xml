NIGERIANS, KEEP ON PLAYING WITH YOUR LIVES. People who knows that their govt and leaders do not care, yet they are never careful themselves. Illiteracy will continue to take more lives. I also blame passengers who confuse overspeeding with arriving on time. Hey you roadsafety man, tell me the speed limit for passenger lorries? He does not know it. Tell me how much is the cost of a number plate? He says it is 20,000 naira (though the govt fixed it at 5000). People who know the price of things without knowing the value of money, will continue to pay extreme prices like this: every week it is the same story, without any solution. Are we Africans caused? Why do we neglect history and allow it to repeat itself daily?</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zko2p</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6flb</id></website><link>http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/03/16-die-81-others-injured-as-lorry-crashes-into-forest/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T06:02:48+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T22:45:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwqx3k</id><link>http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/03/16-die-81-others-injured-as-lorry-crashes-into-forest/#comment-481285075</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ct79o</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
