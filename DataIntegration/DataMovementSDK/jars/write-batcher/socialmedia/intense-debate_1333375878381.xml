I thought you would find it humorous to see two naked people outside your house with butterfly nets. They told me you did and invited them in to enjoy crumpets and tea. As it turns out they were former students of yours who couldn't find jobs so went to work for the asylum. 
They informed me that you wrote poetry and they introduced it each Monday night to the "guests" and you are now the hit of the asylum.Â  Who would have guessed? Anyway, they have no intention of bringing you in from the Cold except on election day where you apparently offerd to give the inmates an inspirational speech.
