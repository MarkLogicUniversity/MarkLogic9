	First Scottish wine to be produced07 Feb 2010
		
The first commercially-produced wine from grapes ripened in Scotland is to be 
  launched, if there is enough sunshine.


	


Pete Gottgens, a top chef, is planning to harvest grapes at his Perthshire 
  hotel later this year, and wants to use them to produce a crisp Riesling.


But Tom Cannavan, a wine critic and author, was sceptical about the end 
  product, after Mr Gottgens has harvests his grapes in September. 



â€œThey might end up with a palatable white wine, which they will have to add 
  sugar to, but it will not be at connoisseur level,â€&#157; he said. 



â€œThe quality will probably be kind of middling, but I imagine the quirkiness 
  of having a Scottish wine will spark a lot of interest. 




â€œThe basic rule of thumb is that grapes need 100 days to ripen and in that 
  time they need a certain amount of Heat and Sunlight, and I donâ€™t think 
  Scotland has the climate.â€&#157;
