That was the time the show was a singing contest, now we are rationalizing why better singers get voted Off with plenty of good excusese post mortem. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Â 

This isn't even about arguing over who won previous seasons, or the fact that not everyone is going to have the same favorite contestants, but do you actually think that the first four or five seasons didn't see people arguing over who got eliminated? Â You missed the whole Tamyra Gray controversy? Â Or, Kelly Clarkson saying that she caught a lot of Heat from the crew who work at AI, who thought that she shouldn't have won? Â So, Justin is a better singer than Tamyra and everybody else that competed that season?

These are just rhetorical questions, that are just meant to show that these discussions are not new.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yi97j</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q17i</id></website><link>http://www.mjsbigblog.com/american-idol-11-%e2%80%93-top-10-results-%e2%80%93-recap-videos-and-photos.htm</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T23:38:21+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T02:28:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi693c</id><link>http://www.mjsbigblog.com/american-idol-11-%e2%80%93-top-10-results-%e2%80%93-recap-videos-and-photos.htm#comment-474153159</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6i2wm</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
