The liberals are the ones who constantly forge public policy based on the perception of the "latest scare" ie, there will be a new ice age (1970's) no there will be global warming and everyone will drown (present day) There are too many peopel and we will all starve in the next 20 years (1970's) So many pesticides are sprayed there will be insects and the food chain will collapse (1970's led to the Banning of DDT and the death of 20 to 30 million by the worlds #1 killer, malaria) This is such blatant bullshit that it boggles my sluggish conservative mind. I am willing to bet that my IQ remains actively higher and more acute when I am drinking my Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch than the idiots who came to these conclusions when they are stone Cold sober. To quote a darling of the liberal crowd, "Stupid is as Stupid does."</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zyo7n</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/r665</id></website><link>http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/is-conservatism-our-default-ideology-40703/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T11:19:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T22:26:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwq6x9</id><link>http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/is-conservatism-our-default-ideology-40703/#comment-481270382</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a4q8e</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
