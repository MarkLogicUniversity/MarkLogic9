Bobby, saying grace in the film Talladega Nights: 'Dear Lord baby Jesus,
 we thank you so much for this bountiful harvest of Dominos, KFC and the
 Always delicious Taco Bell. I just want to take time to say thank you 
for my family. My two sons, Walker and Texas Ranger, or TR as we call 
him, and, of course, my red-hot smokinâ€™ wife, Carley, who is a 
stone-Cold fox.'"
