Well, to trade down from eight (1400 points) to 22 (780 points) would be a prospect value difference of 620 points,.. Meaning that IFF Cleveland were to move up to eight.. Theyd have to give us their 1st round pick at 22 (780), and their 5th slot second round pick number 38 overall (520 points), and their 4th round pick number 100 overall (100 points) to equate the value of our number 8 pick (1400).. So (for Cleveland to move to 8) it would cost them a minimum of,  a 1st round overall pick of #22,  2nd rnd #38, and 4th rnd #100 for the rights to pick number 8..   
 
Meanwhile, I dont like the idea of trading all the wayy down to 22 and behind both NY &amp;amp; NE, while really it would only bring us an additional 4th rounder in comparison to other potential trade down partners, but surely it is a possibility that our Fins would consider while potentially demanding only their 2012 &amp;amp; 2013 1st round picks without the additional 2nd &amp;amp; 4th round 2012 picks..  That difference of 680 points between 8 and 22 could actually be worth the 2013 1st round 27th pick, but Cleveland isnt likely to hold that Spot, so the above compensation would be the likely way to go.. IFF we were to trade down with Cleveland, but that&amp;#039;d be a steep price for them to get Tannehill (who might be suggested to not be worth the #8 pick by itself)!!  Why would he be worth sooo much to them and soo little to us at 8 ?? 
 
I have article to post  2marrow or thereabouts with a scenario other than Cleveland that will include how these numbers are come about, so stay tuned !!  Id offer it here, but that could ruin the jest of my article, so hopefully you all will PLEASE take my word for it for today, and leave that topic alone until tommarrow.. 
 
Ahhhh Screw-it, Ill give&amp;#039;ya a headstart on my next article so you can review what Ive suggested today!!
