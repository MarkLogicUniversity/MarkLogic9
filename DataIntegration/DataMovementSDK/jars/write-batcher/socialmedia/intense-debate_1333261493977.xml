I liked Sonic Colors and Generations, and still play Phantasy Star 0 from time to time. Also, if you aren't familiar with my avatar, let me also add that I'm a huge Puyo junkie(better than Tetris, I said it!), and think all the games it had on the DS were amazing (though mostly Japanese exclusive). No, I don't think SEGA will everÂ shine like it did during the Dreamcast days, but people who say they Burned out after it are crazy. They'll still make bad games, they  have,Â but they will still make good games, andÂ eveen some great games,Â that shouldn't be ignored or dismissed. Honestly,Â I onlyÂ have someÂ ill will for SEGA because they never released Shining ForceÂ Feather in the US. But back to my main point, they don't have to release a Dreamcast 2 to make a good game, they just have toÂ cut OffÂ that growth that's been sucking at it for years. What's it called again? Oh right, Sammy.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/678q5y</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7d9s</id></website><link>http://games.ign.com/articles/122/1221993p1.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T11:58:39+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:03:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwb9rl</id><link>http://games.ign.com/articles/122/1221993p1.html#comment-481430712</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gkugc</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
