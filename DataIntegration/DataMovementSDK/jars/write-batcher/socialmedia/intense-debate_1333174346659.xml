They also don't know how electricity works, but they know they can use it and it works when they need it. The same is true about God. I don't need to know why. It just works. He answers my prayers. Maybe not Always the way I want it to be, but sometimes even better. That is how my faith activates his miracles. The woman in the bible who was Bleeding for years, touched the robe of Jesus. Her faith healed her. Brother, I want to you to experience that, too.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lcs59</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rb19</id></website><link>/2012/03/26/reason-rally-in-washington-d-c/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:19:24+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T15:46:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw6i01</id><link>/2012/03/26/reason-rally-in-washington-d-c/#comment-480876900</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/m0g97</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
