He will never be at the same level as Ric Flair, Hogan, Austin, Rock was.

And between HBK/HHH, workrate-ish HBK will  be better than HHH. He was pretty much what Batista was to Cena that HHH was to Austin.
He wanted to be treated the same but didn't. And as much as people say it, you can bet your ass that he wouldn't be the ''man'' he is today if he hadn't married Steph.

Although i have to agree he was a rather good heel back in Evolution and Steph/HHH regime Era he will never be in the same league as Flair, Hogan, Austin or Rock.
Not by a longshot.


Plus the way Anderson and several others described him in recent years. It seems to me he's punishing it on the talent and making ones who are on the way to the top's life a miserable hell.

Even though i hate and dislike Cena to the core, according to Mr Cena himself, HHH wanted to fire him too.


HHH is a snake in this business. Decent at the stick and okay in the ring especially with the right opponent. But damn watch out for his backstage politics.Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67yg8i</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/e1x9</id></website><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0330/551231/triple-h/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:11:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:43:41+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwzjby</id><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0330/551231/triple-h/#comment-481059153</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ccw9c</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
