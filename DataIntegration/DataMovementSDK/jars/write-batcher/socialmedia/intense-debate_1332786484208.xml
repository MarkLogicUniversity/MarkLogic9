That emboldened him and he thought he was above thee law. His arrest picture is from 2005.Â 
Witnesses have said that Zimmerman made no attempt to help the victim. Those who say that Martin was 6'3, 6'4, 6'5, 180, 200, 230, 240 lbs are all  the beam. Zimmerman was the attacker, who followed this kid and then shot him in Cold blood. The only reason that it is a hate crime is because he used racial epithets in Â the 911 call. The only reason we are here is because he abused his CCW permit, as a violent stalker. He Acted in violation of his carry permit, and under color of false authority.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r0w00</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/justice/florida-teen-shooting-poll/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:18:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:14:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk95xw</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/justice/florida-teen-shooting-poll/index.html#comment-476550358</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zy3kb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
