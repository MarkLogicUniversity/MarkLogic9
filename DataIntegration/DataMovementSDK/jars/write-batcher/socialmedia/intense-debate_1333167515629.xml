We are more pissed Off at gas prices and trying to live our lives. Since the story first broke nationally I have been trying to tell people that whatever you are reading and watching on television is straight BS and don't believe it. I have to say the majority of the residence in Sanford have a good idea what happened and it is not fitting the narrative that has been given. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/675kpj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ju4p</id></website><link>http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/03/30/New-Video-of-George-Zimmerman-Casts-Doubt-on-ABC-Report</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:55:21+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T14:40:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwyzeu</id><link>http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/03/30/New-Video-of-George-Zimmerman-Casts-Doubt-on-ABC-Report#comment-480808463</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7akw</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
