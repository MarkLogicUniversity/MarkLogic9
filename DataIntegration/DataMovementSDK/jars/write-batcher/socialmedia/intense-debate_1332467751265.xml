The folks have been far too complacent for far too long ! My opinion is that this upcoming election is a do-or-die moment in America's history . Obama is a Statist ; he believes that big government is imperative in order to pursue his " social justice " agenda . Here is a quote from Francis Schaeffer's book , How Should We Then Live : " once the Judeo-Christian base is gone , man will not raise his voice in protest unless his peace or personal affluence is threatened " . My personal opinion is that " social justice " is a form of religion ; a substitute for Christianity ! The flawed thinking in this approach to addressing social ill , like poverty , is that the requisite corrective actions are coerced , not voluntary ! Charity that is coerced is no longer charity . Government has replaced the Church as the ' haven of safety ' for the needy or appressed ; personal charity has bern replaced by corporate charity ( no more personal Bleeding here !) . Government becomes the arbiter of moral standards ( the majority opinion vs natural law ) under the Statist form of government ; not God ! We have not yet quite Reached the point where a sufficient number of citizens have been economically devastated , but that time is not far distant - look at Greece ! Only then will the order be given to implement the emergency measures just signed into law by EO . But now , all that Obama needs to implement these " emergency " laws , is a " national crisis "! Who makes that decision ? The man himself ! </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6y8uk7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/omqy</id></website><link>http://frontporchpolitics.com/2012/03/obama-administration-fire-secret-interpretations-patriot-act/</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T21:53:24+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T00:50:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miyuqv</id><link>http://frontporchpolitics.com/2012/03/obama-administration-fire-secret-interpretations-patriot-act/#comment-474102124</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hwf31</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
