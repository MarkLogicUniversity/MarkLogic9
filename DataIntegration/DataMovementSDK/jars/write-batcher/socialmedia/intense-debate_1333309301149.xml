As for his  the field issues- he doesn't have an " the field" issue. He is wrapped up in Bush's mess who def has  the field issues and who will most likely never see playing time again. Guyers mind is as far away from this accident as it can be, bad things happen to good people and i'm sure his name will fade away from this "Off the field issue" back to his performance on the field.. I look for solid numbers from him if he get the playing time and the chance to prove himself at the next level.
