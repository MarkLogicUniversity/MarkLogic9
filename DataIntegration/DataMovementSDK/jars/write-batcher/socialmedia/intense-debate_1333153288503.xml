But, penetrating that defense system becomes impossible when emotions and feelings become the mantra of Liberals when they group together. They become cultish, slaves to each other and the cacophony of the group drowns out the "still, small Voice" of Reason.
I've come to the conclusion that Liberalism is a mental illness. What remains is for the next generation of Psychologists and Psychiatrists to classify it.
