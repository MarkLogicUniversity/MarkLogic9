No doubt in the Heat of the moment a footballer may have called another footballer a B-ack Bastard, do you make this into a racist police investigation? Totally ridiculous.

Let's go one step farther and you make it a racist offence to use the word Black in any kind of altercation on the pitch ie a black player has deliberately hacked me down and could have easily broken my leg. I turn round and call him a Black B and get arrested even though a deliberate assault has been carried out on me. Does this make me a racist? Do I now have the right to sue the other footballer for a racist attack?Â 

Or take the same situation and instead of calling him a Black B I use the words "You thick lipped bastard". Do I get arrested for racial abuse? The point is this leads us down a very difficult road and it is impossible to legislate against. That is why Blatter is right for a change.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/miylnd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8894556/Fifa-president-Sepp-Blatter-there-is-no-racism-in-football.html</link><postedTime>2011-11-16T17:26:13+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-11-16T19:51:02+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/ear2oi</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8894556/Fifa-president-Sepp-Blatter-there-is-no-racism-in-football.html#comment-364990926</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8d3u9</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-11-16</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
