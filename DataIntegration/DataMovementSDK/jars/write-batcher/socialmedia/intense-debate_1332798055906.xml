To Ron Paul supporters: You aren't going to convince anybody when 30 of you show up and bombard a website with cries of corporate owner media blocking your message when it isn't a problem with getting your message heard; it is a problem with people not agreeing with your message. Your problems are no different than any other political group trying to  relevancy when they are outside of the mainstream. By all means, continue to make the case... but try and Dial it down a notch from Bieber-Fever to somewhere in the realm of not-creepy.

To Ron Paul opponents/people that just don't care and think RP supporters are walking late night comedy jokes: Does anybody seriously think these people will be convinced of anything that doesn't come out of RP's mouth? Please quit feeding them.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r1t8o</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/h432</id></website><link>http://cw.ua.edu/2012/03/26/ron-paul-is-the-only-one-we-can-trust/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T05:17:02+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T20:26:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkpue3</id><link>http://cw.ua.edu/2012/03/26/ron-paul-is-the-only-one-we-can-trust/#comment-476714409</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5c9q9</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
