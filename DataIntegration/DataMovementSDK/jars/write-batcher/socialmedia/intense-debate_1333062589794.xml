I want this phone, though I want to wait to see what the Galaxy S3 holds, but then there's a small possibility that T-Mo's One X incarnation will be the G4x... All that and I have an upgrade to Burn...  Le sigh.

Though I'm not making a big fuss about non-removable . It kind of sucks, but as long as they build it where I don't have to do a Battery pull and if so, then have some sort of fail safe (perhaps inserting/ejecting the sim) then I'll be gravy!

The only thing that bugs me is lack of removable memory... this wouldn't be as big of a deal if they at least had 32 gigs on board instead of 16.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zl7w8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/59i3</id></website><link>http://www.tmonews.com/2012/03/htc-one-s-release-date-revealed-as-monday-april-22nd/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:40:16+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:08:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3qfir</id><link>http://www.tmonews.com/2012/03/htc-one-s-release-date-revealed-as-monday-april-22nd/#comment-479610515</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
