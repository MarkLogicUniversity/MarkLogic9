Zimmerman to boil the tragedy down to a simple matter of race, forgetting that
racists come in all colors. That was immediately evident when I saw the photo
of Trayvon in his football uniformâ€”obviously younger than 17. 



He did not deserve to be murdered, but perhaps attitude
(something more evident in the photos of him a little closer to his age when he
died) may have contributed SOMEWHAT to this tragedy. He may have been 
(in some of the reporting) like a "Â NO_LIMIT_N***A"â€”Trayvon's
OWN Twitter handle. 



Every photo of Trayvon in the majority of news accounts
shows him as an "angelic" thirteen (or so)-year-old. That is FRAMING,
pure and simple.



What we do not see was someone who wears a grill, Twittering
about Glocks and "dabbled" in pot... the subsequent facts of his life
that have come out (thank you, Daily Mail). Is it possible he that look the
partâ€”in attitude AND dress.



Let me be clear, this is NO REASON TO GET SHOT! 



Consider this scenario... Trayvon is walking around alone, certainly
not wearing the football uniform presented in the media.

Every photo of Trayvon in the majority of news accounts

pure and simple.

What we do not see was an olderÂ teenagerÂ who wears a "grill," Twittering
about Glocks and "dabbled" in pot... the subsequent details of his life
that have come out (thank you, Daily Mail). Is it possible he that looked the
partâ€”inÂ dressÂ AND attitude.

Let me be clear, this is NO REASON TO GET SHOT! 

Consider this scenario... Trayvon is walking around alone, certainly
not wearing the football uniform presented in the media. 

A "neighborhood watch" volunteer confronts himâ€”rightfully
or not. Trayvon becomes confrontational (again rightly or not), angered that
someone would even question his place in the neighborhoodâ€”an attitude that is prevalent
in current youth culture,Â worshipingÂ the "thug" life.Â It is how someÂ youngÂ people self-identify, and the anger that comes with living the (real or imagined)
"thug life."

It CERTAINLY could happen; there are many people that would
respond with anger after asked what they are doing in an areaâ€”regardless of
skin colorâ€”especially by someone who is NOT a police officer. 

Wouldn't it be reasonable to say that Trayvon thought, "Who are YOU to
hassle me, is it because I am BLACK?"

The situation quickly gets Heatedâ€”Zimmerman justified (at
least to himself) in asking what this kid doing walking around the
neighborhood, alone at night. In response, Trayvon pushes back, thinking he
doesn't have to answer to this "cracker" (as in the t-shirts that
have been going around). 

What Trayvon PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW prior to confronting Zimmerman,
was that he was carrying a gun.
