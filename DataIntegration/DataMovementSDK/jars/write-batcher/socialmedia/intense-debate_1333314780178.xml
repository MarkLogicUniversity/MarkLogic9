They decided, for better or worse, to go with one infield backup and two outfield backups.Â  You seem to favor two infield backups and you may be proven right.Â  But, for Betancourt to get enough ab-bats to remain fresh, they want him to back up all three infield positions.Â  He does play third well enough, but probably not as well as Kouzmanoff.Â  However, he has more power than Kouz and may be a slightly better hitter, overall.Â  

There are no right and wrong decisions here; it's a matter of guesstimate.Â  History may prove you right if Moustakas goes down with an injury early and they need a 3B for an extended period of time.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zoag9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmb</id></website><link>http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/29/3523348/royals-finalize-roster-with-teaford.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:18:54+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:37:48+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwsr14</id><link>http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/29/3523348/royals-finalize-roster-with-teaford.html#comment-481878306</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cn72c</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
