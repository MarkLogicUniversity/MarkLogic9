Personally I've cut down on social networks by getting away from my phone, or when I have it with me, Â not checking them status on it. At least, when I'm  the computer, I'm really Off.
As of the Cold turkey experiment, congrats, it's courageous :) I think in the long run you still need the social networks for your business/technical watch. What I'd like to achieve is to do it just once per day. Like take a full hour, go through the stream, pick articles I want to read, and be done with it.
As for the conclusion : could not agree more. But it takes some serious sleeves up-rollin' :)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zutp9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5957</id></website><link>http://blog.fabio.mancinelli.me/2012/03/29/Information_overload.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:51:19+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:14:40+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3jek5</id><link>http://blog.fabio.mancinelli.me/2012/03/29/Information_overload.html#comment-479959168</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h0vxp</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
