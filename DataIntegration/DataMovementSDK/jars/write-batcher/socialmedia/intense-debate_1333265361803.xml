so early on alienated the gop and contributed to the conservative uprising. strong in forgien 
policy, but thats it. 

Obama has a glass jaw, wages, immigration, fuel prices, mortgage crisis, war and now with
so much to work with, romney is still wrestling with three candidates who have no chance, and the GOP leadership has still not recognized romney as the peoples choice. the GOP is waisting not only many millions of dollars that could make the difference in the Obama campaign. Butt; for the political capital expended, some, over issues Resolved fifty years ago. 

romney has cowtowed to far to the right, i dont care if romney tap's pancho villa for the VP
Spot, he is not going to get the Hispanic vote. the womens vote? try asking them for a change. for the womens vote, obama leads romney on evry age group and class.
