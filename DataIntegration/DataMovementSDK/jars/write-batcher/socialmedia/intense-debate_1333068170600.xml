It's not to say Burke is without fault.Â  He's made mistakes, particularly in his UFA signings and his philosophical disagreements with Wilson.Â  Luckily, I believe these things only hindered Plan A.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zru2m</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/v4x4</id></website><link>http://mapleleafshotstove.com/2012/03/29/329-marlies-this-week/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:00:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:27:39+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3najr</id><link>http://mapleleafshotstove.com/2012/03/29/329-marlies-this-week/#comment-479625959</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gx0pm</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
