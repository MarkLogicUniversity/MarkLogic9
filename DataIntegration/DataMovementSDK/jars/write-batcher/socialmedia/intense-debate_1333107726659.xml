Moderate to conservative democrats crafted it, voted for it and lost their seats because of it - to radical far-right conservatives promising their largely elderly constituents that they would keep the government's hands Off of their medicaid. Liberals took their ball and went home with Ralph Nader back in 2000. They haven't been a factor in American political leadership in any meaningful sense since the early 70's. Sorry to pour Cold water on your steaming pile of bs.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zzxhw</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/eyjq</id></website><link>http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/why-health-care-is-a-losing-issue-for-republicans/255148/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:15:48+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:44:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3open</id><link>http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/why-health-care-is-a-losing-issue-for-republicans/255148/#comment-480034748</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/csn6k</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
