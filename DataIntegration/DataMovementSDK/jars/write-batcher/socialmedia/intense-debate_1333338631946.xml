The Labour party pursued a borrow and blame strategy in opposition and tried to blame the coalition government for having to make cuts to the public services in order to pay Off some of the debt. 

You cannot blame Francis Maude for advising ordinary members of the public to stock up on fuel on the grounds that there was going to be a strike after the UNITE union had held a ballot and voted for industrial action but had deliberately refused to clarify when the strike was going to take place. The UNITE union have caused this chaos not the government. They wanted to make political capital out of the crisis and now a woman is lying in a hospital bed with 40% Burns.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67i87f</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/fuel/9177951/Fuel-strike-government-fails-to-calm-panic-buying.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:44:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T16:43:00+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwwnr8</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/fuel/9177951/Fuel-strike-government-fails-to-calm-panic-buying.html#comment-481982798</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zaer9</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
