(Extremes of Global warming economically,climatically, financially,socially and Militarily). I look forward to another Arizona summer. Trayvon Martin was a sacrificial lamb in a long line of inhumanity,injustice, double-standardÂ and selective, status quo (misplaced) Family values,principles, Ideals,religion, economics,politics, and corruptionÂ tainting reality itself...Like tainted- "broccli".

Is every America(n) ,equal-ly, "protected" under law and Constitution? is the question in 1968 and 2012. It  what end/side of that "gun","protection",law-enforcement, Justice and constitution your on. In the FINAL analysis,ultimately, every American has the right to "defend themselves" that's what the declaration of Independence,Bill of rights, Constitution, Freedom,Liberty, and Civil-rights declare..."make your stand" or fall under tyranny, terrorism, intimidation, alienation,corruption,racism, slavery, oppression, deception,repression, subversion,apathy, obstruction, SUPPRESSION,Â extremism, generation after generation. "America face some challenges",alright! like over past-Two- centuries, and I ain't talking Canadian Oil sands....but like A great African-American Musician,Jimi Hendrix, prophe(ll)tically tried to warn us all,poetically and lyrically, "And castles made of sand,melts! into the Sea, eventually" well! the Tide and tsunami of time waits for "NO" one (Not Nations/Peoples, Empires or Civilizations). "Time and chance" happen to us all.

Take a look at the 44th or 37th President of the United States ( President Obama is facing a COLD-War(Foe,Romney-Teaparty) at home, while,President Nixon, also a great American, in his resignation speech, prophe(ll)tically tried to warn us of the challenges We faced,Collectively-Ironically). Do/did they both believe in the same thing, America? The answer is "YES", the ONLY, difference, between them is "Time, chance and now BIG-unlimited-$$$$$$$$$". Trayvin Martin(Generations) never had his/their chance ( He could've been President Obama's Son,but, he could also have been a President). There is "NO" "resignation" or "obstruction" for many Americans just Hate and racism and constant battles, struggles for civil-rights,justice,equality underÂ brutalizing, Poverty-debt, corruption,counterfeits,immoral legislatures/Law-enforcement/Justice of the Peace,Politicians, Private-sector,too-big-to-FAIL- Economies,Law and CONSTITUTION(S) (America has One Constitution,Law and "We The" People). POWER! "To, We The People"!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6znd8r</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ewhe</id></website><link>http://www.thegrio.com/specials/trayvon-martin/a-look-at-hate-crimes.php</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:24:04+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:00:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3pcgn</id><link>http://www.thegrio.com/specials/trayvon-martin/a-look-at-hate-crimes.php#comment-480047672</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/apzzq</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
