What I don't see is why we have to have such a focus on religion in this country.  Why does the media feel compelled to make it all loom so large? And have it so linked to our failed political system.  To me it's like flag Burning.  Just another distraction from the real issue of our total lack of a viable governmental system or economic reality.

There are tons of us out here who just live decent lives, do our best to learn whatever lessons we set for ourselves, and try to progress enough on the soul level to be able to stay Off this rock for a little longer next time around.

It's not as complicated as all of these 'religions' make it out to be.  It IS possible to just wake up in the morning and be good.  Most of these religions just look like money-making systems to distort the flow of resources away from any beneficial purpose and cause chaos for the rest of us.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hcpj2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ant8</id></website><link>http://www.alternet.org/story/154710/former_mormon_what_americans_need_to_know_about_mormonism/comments/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T04:55:04+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T12:21:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/msj9hp</id><link>http://www.alternet.org/story/154710/former_mormon_what_americans_need_to_know_about_mormonism/comments/#comment-478304849</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c71je</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
