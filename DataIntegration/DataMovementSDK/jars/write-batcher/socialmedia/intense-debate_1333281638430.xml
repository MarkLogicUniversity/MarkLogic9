Dad must not have listened to the 911 call that his own son made.Fact1,he initially gave his location/an address then told the dispatcher to have the police call his cell phone when they arrived because he was following Trayvon,Zimmerman began to run because he said"he's running now,these assholes Always get away"Fact2 Zimmerman was not going to store,HE told dispatcher that he was patroling neighborhood when he Spotted the suspicious person.Fact3 Zimmerman had "NO' injuries or blood to indicate he had been beaten(watch the video dad). Fact 4 He is twice the size of Trayvon Fact5 Trayvon was desperately screaming for help,that was not the cry of a 28yo white male,you don't have to be a forensic specialist to figure out who's voice it is.Zimmerman's dad is a fucking liar! I guess now we are tobelieve that in between his cries for help, Trayvon,told a man with a gun,that he was going to kill HIM,with his hoodie I guess!Fuck the Zimmermans,that shit is sooo ridiculous.Arrest George Zimmerman Now! and the police didn't tell this old man to be quiet,they've been talking their damn self,trying to clear themselves,why in the hell would they tell him not to talk.Stop with the lies.Your son murdered an innocent child and nothing you or your family says can change that.You will be judged by the allmighty Judge.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zcaks</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/u6cr</id></website><link>http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh7Fkfv5MhC6Xw4JrC</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T05:42:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T05:04:14+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwf6jw</id><link>http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh7Fkfv5MhC6Xw4JrC#comment-481550542</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7npg</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
