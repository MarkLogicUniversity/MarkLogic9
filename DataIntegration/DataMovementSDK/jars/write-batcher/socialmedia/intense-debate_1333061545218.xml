Just because the police knew him , does not make him not guilty. He was aÂ wannabe cop and mostÂ are a bit over the top that I have knownÂ !Â  He loved the power!

Â  Anyone with a cut on the back of the head that needed stitchesÂ would have been bandaged up , a broken nose would have been visable also. His clothes as witnessesÂ say are the same ones at the scene, are clean , no blood , dirt etc.Â  Even at this distance you can see his shirt is Tucked in and is clean.Â  SomethingÂ just does not ringÂ true with theÂ Zimmerman account.Â  I know we are not suppose to judge , but it isÂ hard not to see, this man is not hurt , he was not beaten up as stated andÂ  he stalked and killed that boy in Cold blood.Â  This is a police cover up , and he needs to be charged with murder .Â 

Â  If Trayvon were your son you would want justice , I know I would!
