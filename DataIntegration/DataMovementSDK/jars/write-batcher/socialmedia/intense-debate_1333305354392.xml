If the banking system provides the mortgage, it's NEVER the savers' money.
It's Always created on the Spot. (You give me the house and pay me interest, I create the money for you.)

Re how the MMTers see the money phenom, none of them have ever explained HOW the government destroys your tax payments and issues new money when it spends.
And, for some (Mosler) reason, they do not have a problem with private bank-credit money creation.
They just want the government to step in and spend freely (up to non-inflation, full-employment) when the private bankers screw things up.
I don't think Keen is there yet at all.He just wants to re-regulate the speculators, and recognizes that we can't pay back all the debts.
But he's very unclear on how to do that.

I hope you can go to Berlin.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/679vvo</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/y3qw</id></website><link>http://overthepeak.com/wordpress/archives/7118</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T09:52:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T12:53:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwiozw</id><link>http://overthepeak.com/wordpress/archives/7118#comment-481806682</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ah69</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
