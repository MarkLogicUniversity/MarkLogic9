He has the nerve to criticize something while working for the "Miami Herald".....?? 

Speaking of CLOWNS.. How about criticizingÂ your overhyped Heat, whileÂ explaining how Durant &amp; OKC made them their b*tch last night! Along with the fact that Lebron continues to be mediocre &amp; unable to win championships.. Not to mention their no-named coach! 

Ahem..Â 
Now back on the subject of pro wrestling!Â I'm sure this virgin clownÂ knows nothing about the biz, and has nothing better to do than run his mouth about something he has no idea of. 

He's probably bitter because he tried to enter the stadium &amp; they kicked him out!
What's ridiculous are these so-called reporters posting worthless articles in a pathetic attempt for attention and pure boredom! 

I hate guys like these... Somebody find this ass-clown a real hobby or girlfriend QUICK!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rskjl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/cq26</id></website><link>http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/251973-miami-herald-calls-wwe-talent-qbiggest-clowns-in-sportsq</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T13:50:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:49:33+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk99eb</id><link>http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/251973-miami-herald-calls-wwe-talent-qbiggest-clowns-in-sportsq#comment-476578318</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/l5zya</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
