At his school, Trayvon Martin once had marijuana residue in a bag in his possession, a pipe for smoking it, and a screwdriver used by burglars.

It was discovered that there were items of women's jewelry in his backpack, none of which he could justify as being his. The school police reported this to the Miami-Dade Police Department as a possible case of stolen merchandise.

In addition, he had painted obscene graffiti and was Spotted by school officials hiding and covering his face.

His Twitter account includes a comment by his cousin on February 21 that speaks of him "swinging at the bus driver."

His Facebook page includes pictures of him displaying obscene gestures, showing Off his gold teeth (like a typical black criminal), and standing with his pants sagging to his knees.
