Flair declined because he knows Shane wants to legitimately kick his ass for witnessing the Nature Boy sexually assault Johnny Ace's girlfriend at a bar.

Look up the interview on YouTube if you're interested in this crazy story. According to Shane, it happened in front of many people. Shane pushed Flair (who at this point had the girl lying on the dance floor while dangling his exposed genitals)  the girl and was informed by Arn Anderson that he had major locker room Heat on him for saving the her. He said he idolized Ric until he saw what a sh*tty human being he was.

Moral of the story, you don't Always want to meet your heroes.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z9uzn</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/cq26</id></website><link>http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/252245-impact-wrestling-results-032912-</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:54:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:35:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwr3wd</id><link>http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/252245-impact-wrestling-results-032912-#comment-480927392</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zm0ge</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
