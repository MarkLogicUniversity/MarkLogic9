...Sewage enters coastal waters when it is released directly into the sea, is carried via rivers and gullies, or drains into groundwater from septic tanks and pit latrines which then flows into the sea through sand and limestone. Sewage effluents carry bacteria and pathogenic organisms which can cause illness or even death, Depending on their concentration and virulence. Most sewage microorganisms are killed in the sea by the action of salt, high temperatures, and high light, but the rate of their destruction is greatly slowed if waters are turbid with suspended sediments. The major human health problems which are known to be caused by micro-organisms in sewage contaminated COASTAL waters include gastrointestinal illness (stomach pains and Diarrhea), ear infections, shellfish poisoning, and cholera.
