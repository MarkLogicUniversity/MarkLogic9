I mean to get around to them but it's all down to what Sam Prescott was saying above about how there's so much quality media to get through. Also my XboxÂ 360 is plugged into a small TV (the Will gets the big TV, soon to be replaced by the PS3) so I have trouble reading the onscreen instructions in games, which are usually tiny and it sort of puts me Off. A lot of the time it's a load of FPS's I've bought and in the end I just think, "nah, can't be ar*ed" - I guess deep down I'm not convinced that I won't be wasting my time on an antiquated experience that I've played through before.

Also, I tried to play through Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes on Gamecube and couldn't get past something like the first or second level, I kept getting Spotted and couldn't find a way around before I gave up! I suppose that would have to be my biggest shame, I used to think I was good at videogames!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6t2g7t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7d9s</id></website><link>http://games.ign.com/articles/122/1222111p1.html</link><postedTime>2012-04-02T07:43:02+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T08:54:55+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0oedw</id><link>http://games.ign.com/articles/122/1222111p1.html#comment-483364258</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g1771</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
