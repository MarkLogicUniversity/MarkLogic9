Im using the Archer Artillery System as an example. Its regular controls as a jeep, except since he said in the post it needs to be operated by one person. The "A" buttonÂ transfersÂ the vehicle from mobile, which can Reach speeds of 50mph, to shooting mode which makes about 40 seconds. It doesn't have to take 40 seconds in game maybe like 5-10 seconds, but once its in Â firing mode, it brings up the mortar map screen and you can also move between first and third person while in this state. For teammates to help, they can Spot the enemies, but if a teammate is approaching a set up truck they can press the "B" button and it will give them a pair of binoculars that can assist in Spotting. Only one teammate can do this, and it will add a lens flare to wherever the soldier that is Spotting is. If anyone has any other ideas or anything to add I'm all ears.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l5vov</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/bg5n</id></website><link>http://mp1st.com/2012/03/26/battlefield-3-armored-kill-map-sizes-consoles-will-not-get-commo-rose-no-more-specialized-assignments-and-more/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:45:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-27T01:49:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/ms2tcb</id><link>http://mp1st.com/2012/03/26/battlefield-3-armored-kill-map-sizes-consoles-will-not-get-commo-rose-no-more-specialized-assignments-and-more/#comment-477033106</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
