Facts from the dispatch call:Â  He followed the kid for only a very short distance, then when the dispatch asked if he was following , he said yeah, then they said "we don't need you to do that", then he says OK and stops.Â  The kid runs Off. Zimmerman was walking back to what was presumably his vehicle and said to the dispatcher that he would wait for the police to arrive.Â Â  For some reason the kid decided to come back - and there was a confrontation.Â  There would have been no killing hadÂ the kid simply not decided to confront Zimmerman.Â  Police report indicates that Zimmerman was Bleeding from the nose, his head was bloody, and he had wet grass stains on his back.Â  Police report indicates Zimmerman was treated by EMTs.Â  Â We have eyewitnesses that say the Kid was on top of Zimmerman beating him.Â  There's is simply no disputing that.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zclg5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/second-trayvon-martin-twitter-feed-identified/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:00:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:53:10+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ntnc</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/second-trayvon-martin-twitter-feed-identified/#comment-479646435</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5xffr</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
