He forgets there is a city to run as he ramps up his 2014 campaign (Is he declaring the CFRB show as part of his campaign contributions?). Of course, he should probably forget about the running the city thing, since he isn't very good at it. The Weight loss event seems to be disappearing too. Did he have his weigh-in today? He's probably back on the nightly tub of ice cream to help  him in his time of loss(es), and is too embarrassed to reveal his weight Gain. He'll be happily out of the public eye after the next municipal election unless citizens and council find a way to remove him sooner.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r3ng5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4r1e</id></website><link>http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/03/26/the-political-panel-asks-rob-ford-for-six-nfl-teams-chocolate-unicorns/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:23:06+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:58:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk1khp</id><link>http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/03/26/the-political-panel-asks-rob-ford-for-six-nfl-teams-chocolate-unicorns/#comment-476491745</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dn1gi</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
