They have all these conservative media Spots radio,television, and newspapers and so forth and what do we have. When something happens to us what do we have many of us live day to day struggling and many times we try to keep each other down they stick together. We face black on black hatred and hatred from other races. I can't really say what the solution is because some things will never change. All I can hope for is that this young man gets due justice but I won't even bank on that we had a young man that died here years ago in West Memphis. He had a toy gun and was shot and killed by a police officer and he hasn't gotten due justice yet. I truely believe the saying it ain't no justice it's just us. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hhzl0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ewhe</id></website><link>http://www.thegrio.com/specials/trayvon-martin/the-thug-ification-of-trayvon-martin-smear-campaign-distracts-from-the-case.php</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T13:21:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:13:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3npsg</id><link>http://www.thegrio.com/specials/trayvon-martin/the-thug-ification-of-trayvon-martin-smear-campaign-distracts-from-the-case.php#comment-479662421</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzyfn</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
