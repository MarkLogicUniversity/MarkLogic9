The facts revealed so far is that the Latino saw a suspicous  personÂ  in his neighborhood and was following this character to see what he was up to. He calls 911 and reports what he is doing and while talking notices the Blakk beginning to run. Now there is no way that this shiort plump Latino going to run down that young Blakk. The Blakk had to stop to confront the man watching him, and instead of letiing the man know that he was just passing through, he punnches the latino knocking him to the concrete, which causes the Latino to pull his gun and fire in self defense. The police reproted that teh Latino was Bleeding from the mouth and back of the head. Now the Blakk knew he could easily outrun the plump latino, but did not because he saw a chance to Act like the niggrr that he really was.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6y9qas</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/22/sanford-police-chief-steps-down-amid-outrage-over-shooting-death-teen/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:53:06+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T01:09:39+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miykgp</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/22/sanford-police-chief-steps-down-amid-outrage-over-shooting-death-teen/#comment-474112001</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8nxjb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
