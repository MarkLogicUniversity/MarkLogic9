If a child is born with both sex organs, and we know this is a medical fact just ask your doctor, and the parents and the doctor make a decision to remove one of the organs and raise the child as boy/girl Depending on the medical decision and then as an adult that child discovers that it is attracted to the same sex that was medically "assigned" to them, are they biblical sinners and condemned for their "homosexuality?" You do understand all you fine christian people that in God's world people are born with their orientation but sometimes things happen, like hermaphoditic children. Sometimes the wiring does not match the organs. Is this God's little joke or just cruelty? Miss that old time religion? Burn a few witches, kill some pagans, enslave people. That can't be wrong, its in the bible. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z1eum</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mx4f</id></website><link>http://www.kentucky.com/2012/03/29/2131473/wildcat-wearhouse-and-hands-on.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:27:51+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T15:50:08+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw63qz</id><link>http://www.kentucky.com/2012/03/29/2131473/wildcat-wearhouse-and-hands-on.html#comment-480880202</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lzyj1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
