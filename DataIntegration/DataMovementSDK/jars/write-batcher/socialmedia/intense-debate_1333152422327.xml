What is hate speech think about it. Is it black person ever accused of hate speech, No. Is a Muslim ever convicted or accused of hate speech, no. Are homosexuals( faggets, queers, perverts, and other type antisocial scum) ever convicted of hate speech, no.

So I am sick and tired of Crying babies complaining anytime their feelings are hurt just because they are called what they are. A potato is a potato and onion is an onion so why isn't it queer eye fagget? Don't buckle under to these people just because they whining and cry and kick their feet. I'm sick of them and I'm sick of the people that pander to them. I'm not just speaking of homosexuals are speaking of every minority that wishes to become known as a victim. They can just get together and go Off in a corner and have a pity party. They are a blight on the human species.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zrvne</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ogrn</id></website><link>http://godfatherpolitics.com/4439/gay-bullies-target-apparel-company-because-it-wont-print-shirts-for-gay-pride-festival/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T12:51:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T11:28:52+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwgjnd</id><link>http://godfatherpolitics.com/4439/gay-bullies-target-apparel-company-because-it-wont-print-shirts-for-gay-pride-festival/#comment-480639176</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5hdzm</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
