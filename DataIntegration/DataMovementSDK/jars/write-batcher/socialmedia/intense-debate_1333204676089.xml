I have added them to the post. The instructions actually say that that you should add a few drops of chlorine bleach to the water and run it through the filter before long term storage.

As far as freezing, it is a big issue during winter, but it is the same problem for ceramic filters like the MSR Miniworks EX. I Always carry an insulative cover during winter. I don't know of a good solution to the problem. If there isn't enough snow everywhere to just melt for water, some sort of filtration has to be done as chemical treatments have a very hard time int he Cold.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67c7dk</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tfsl</id></website><link>http://woodtrekker.blogspot.com/2012/03/sawyer-squeeze-water-filtration-system.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:44:42+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:54:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwz0ss</id><link>http://woodtrekker.blogspot.com/2012/03/sawyer-squeeze-water-filtration-system.html#comment-481069904</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ek6fe</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
