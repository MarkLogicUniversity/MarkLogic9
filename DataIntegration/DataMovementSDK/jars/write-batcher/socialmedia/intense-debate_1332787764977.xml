Electricity demand varies by a factor of three or more,  on the time of day and year. On a daily basis, grid operators must deal with large factory equipment coming on and offline, millions of people turning air conditioners and other appliances on and , and fossil and nuclear power plants breaking down.Â  In contrast, changes in the output of wind plants are relatively easy for system operators to integrate, because changes in wind energy output occur slowly and are generally forecastable 4-24 hours in advance. Opposite changes in electricity demand often cancel them out.

Â 

Furthermore, the grid backs up all power sources. Wind plantsâ€™ output varies slowly and predictably over many hours, allowing grid operators to use slower- reserves that cost 97% less than the expensive fast-Acting reserves needed as backup for fossil and nuclear generators.

Â 

For example, in February 2011, millions of homes and businesses in Texas suffered rolling blackouts because more than 75 fossil-fired power plants broke down due to Cold weather. Those rolling blackouts would have been significantly worse had wind energy not kept producing at and above the levels the grid operator was expecting, providing enough power to keep the lights on for millions of Texas residents.

Â 

Following that event, the head of the Texas grid operator explicitly commended wind energy for its role in helping to keep the lights on.

Â 

Studies by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have confirmed that when you combine wind resources over a moderately large geographic area, the output becomes far more stable as wind resources in one region backup wind resources in another region. As a result, the majority of the energy output of the wind turbine can be relied on for meeting power system capacity needs and thus replace the need for conventional generating capacity.
