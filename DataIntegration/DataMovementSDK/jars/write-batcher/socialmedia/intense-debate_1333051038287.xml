The homicide detective who investigated didn't believe Zimmerman's self-defense story.

Zimmerman claimed he was beaten up by the kid and his head was Sliced open and he was profusely Bleeding, so he had to shoot. Â But police surveillance video from when he arrived at the police station shows that to be not true. Â He had not a scratch on him. Â No broken nose, no cuts, no Bleeding, no bandages, no bruises.

[...]
[Sanford, Fla., Investigator Chris]Â Serino filed an affidavit on Feb. 26, the night that Martin was shot and killed by Zimmerman, that stated he was unconvinced Zimmerman's version of events.
