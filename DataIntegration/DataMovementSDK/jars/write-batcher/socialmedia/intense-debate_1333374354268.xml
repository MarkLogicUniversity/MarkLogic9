Obama has already ticked  the Catholics trying to meddle in Church affairs angering many. Now Al and Jesse and the gang are really going to tick  many whites with this Martin case, plus many Libs are unhappy with Obama too.

The  only group that favor what Jesse and Al are doing is the blacks who are going to vote for Barry no matter what so no Gain there.

This may become a big losing situation for Obama especially if Al and Jesse spark race riots and Burn a city or two down.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67491f</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4847</id></website><link>http://www.therightscoop.com/mark-levin-who-the-hell-died-and-made-al-sharpton-attorney-general/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:39:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:04:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwi3xe</id><link>http://www.therightscoop.com/mark-levin-who-the-hell-died-and-made-al-sharpton-attorney-general/#comment-481813386</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/r0l3m</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
