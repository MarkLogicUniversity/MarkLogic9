Last weekend in the city of Chicago alone, gangbangers slaughtered
ten people and wounded another forty. The youngest fatality is only six years
old. The youngest person wounded is only one-year-old. Many of the victim were
pedestrians sprayed with bullets in drive by shootings. The national news has
said nothing about this. 


So why does one shooting in Florida warrant weeks of national
news? Why has there been thousands of articles a day, for the last four days,
about one single shooting? 


Almost all of the news items about George Zimmerman and Trayvon
Martin contains a combination of false statements, opinions presented as facts,
transparent distortions, and a complete absence of some of the most relevant
details. Almost all news items are written solely from the point of view of the
grieving family. The media also fills their articles with outdated baby-faced
pictures of Trayvon. Very few include that he was a towering 6'2â€&#157; football
player. Is the media really reporting the news, or is this classic
agitation/propaganda to advance a political agenda. 


Literally thousands of articles contain at least one false
statement in the first couple of lines. They usually read "George
Zimmerman, a white man," or "shot by a white man." Zimmerman is
described by family as a multiracial Hispanic. His appearance is clearly that
of a Latino/Mestizo individual. However, the media wants him to be white
because that better fits the political narrative they are trying to
artificially create. Many news articles have also claimed the neighborhood is
"mostly white." This is also a lie. The neighborhood is only 49%
white. It is over half non-white. 


All the way back on February 27th, the local Orlando Fox station
interviewed the witness who Dialed 911. Almost none of the thousands of
articles since have mentioned any of the details described by the witness.
Some, however, have attributed false statements to this witness. On March 16th,
the Sanford police department released new details to the Orlando Sentinel.
Once again, these details have been ignored or changed by the media. 


The witness reports that George Zimmerman was on the ground and
Trayvon is on top of him punching him. 


The witness says that George Zimmerman was screaming and yelling
for help. 


Police arrive and find Zimmerman Bleeding on his face and the back
of his head. He also has had grass stains on his back. All this confirms the
story told by Zimmerman and the witness. 


Police play the 911 tape for Trayvon Martin's father, who tells
police that the voice screaming is not the voice of his son. 


The neighborhood this took place in has seen a lot of crime. Would
you be surprised to learn that there were eight burglaries, nine thefts, and a
shooting just in the past year? In fact, the local homeowners' association
reports that George Zimmerman actually caught one thief and aided in the
apprehension of other criminals. The Miami Herald wrote about this on March
17th. None of the thousands of articles and cable news segments that came
after, thought this was important. 


In fact the Miami Herald goes on to interview neighbor, Ibrahim
Rashada, who is black. Rashada â€‹confirms that there has been a lot of crime in
the neighborhood and indicates to the reporter that the perpetrators are
usually black. 


The media also characterizes Trayvon as a "model
student." In fact, he was under a five day suspension when the shooting
took place. That is why he was staying at a house so far from his school on a
school night. A lawyer for Trayvon's family has blocked access to his school
records. However, you have to do something pretty bad to get suspended for five
days. 


Now that you know the suppressed facts of the case, you can for
form a better more balanced opinion. Maybe you still think Zimmerman was wrong
to pull the trigger. However, I think you will come to the conclusion that the
"mainstream" clearly is pushing an agenda. Even when they have to
grossly alter and adjust a story to fit that agenda.
