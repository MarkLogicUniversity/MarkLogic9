Everyone knows how to give an interview, a photo-op and a press release. The police know all the 'weasel words', the reporters know how to stop safe just this side of actionable statements. The book and movie crowd come out fast, they have most of the plot and heart-tugging Spots all roughed in, all that is needed is names and places to make the work complete. 
Â Â  The hekiocopters fly over, the media trucks and buses swoop, the high-pitched heads with cameras breathlessly Spot nothing in seven different ways. The americans are ready for the closeup but are not ready for reality. 
Â Â  And Off on the horizon a shifty-eyed mormon with lots of money ripped from businesses hauls his sturdy sons and obedient wife from state to state, so desperate to be president of this mess that he shakes. He must see something in the country that the rest of us miss. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/679qnk</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4r1e</id></website><link>http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/03/31/rex-murphy-the-tale-of-trayvon-martin-is-a-tragedy-turned-into-a-race-parable/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T09:58:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T11:03:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0p762</id><link>http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/03/31/rex-murphy-the-tale-of-trayvon-martin-is-a-tragedy-turned-into-a-race-parable/#comment-483422616</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ruuam</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
