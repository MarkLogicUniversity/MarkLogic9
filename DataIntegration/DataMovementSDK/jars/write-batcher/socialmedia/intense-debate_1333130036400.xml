I held plenty of political disagreements with the POTUS during my 7 years active duty, but had no problem with order, discipline, and proper subordination.  This is clearly a breach of all three of those things.  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yqiw1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/22/us/marine-obama/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T14:36:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T22:25:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mifsd6</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/22/us/marine-obama/index.html#comment-474859882</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a8gj3</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
