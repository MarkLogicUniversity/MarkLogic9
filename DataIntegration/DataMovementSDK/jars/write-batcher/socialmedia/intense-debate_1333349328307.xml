Cena normally only wrestles wait fight the last 15 minutes of a pay per view and he had to go 30 tonight. Also if you were paying attention Cena fans you would have noticed Rock gave Cena all of his Spots in the match. Rock called and carried the match just like Miz carried the match with Cena last year</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vkpdn</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/e1x9</id></website><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0401/551354/wrestlemania-xviii/</link><postedTime>2012-04-02T02:59:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T05:40:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m09i4v</id><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0401/551354/wrestlemania-xviii/#comment-483302392</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hu36l</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
