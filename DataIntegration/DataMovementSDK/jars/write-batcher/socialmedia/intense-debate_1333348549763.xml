Wharton it kind of concerns me.   Special teams would have been number three on the list except where do you start?  The unit as a whole was "nothing to write home about" from top to bottom!  Hopefully with some of the guys that have recently signed we can address the ST issue.  Games can be one or lost on it and we desperately needed change!  Almost as bad as defense!  Please,  draft defense.  If Kluechly is there pick him but im telling everybody this:  "Spence from Miami" will be a player in the NFL!   And by that I mean a special talent.  He played behind a better DL and overall better players otherwise he would have had close to as many tackles as Kluechly.  And he plays smart and has room to grow physically!  I also like Jerel Worthy's nasty streak.  He played in many a big game and everytime I watched Mich. St he played hard although often double teamed.  If we could snatch him in the 2nd round It would make my dag Burn day!  Fua is a kid we have who could have used a full Off season so the jury is still out on him imo.  Stephon Gilmore will be gone but would love to have him he tackles very well for a CB and at 6'1 3/4 and 4.4 speed he is big and fast enough to handle some of our divisions WR.  Known for liking to get in on tackles "as a corner"!  So physical play from a Colston or J. Jones won't bother him.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6v53kk</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnei</id></website><link>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/31/3141656/carolina-panthers-free-agency.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T23:28:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T06:30:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0j5lf</id><link>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/31/3141656/carolina-panthers-free-agency.html#comment-483315145</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c2n8i</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
