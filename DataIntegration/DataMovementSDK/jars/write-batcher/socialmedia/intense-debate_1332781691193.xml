DAVID LETTERMAN’S TOP 10 BHO, LIBERALS AND THE MSM WILL USE
ON THIS STORY: 


1. Those weren’t my words. I was set up. That guy is
a ventriloquist. 2. The dog ate my homework on this one, like he has on all
international issues. 3. That wasn’t b.h.o.’s voice, it was George Bush. 4. Moooochelle
made me say that so I used the opportunity to teach my daughter’s how to lip
sync. 5. That wasn’t me. It was Andrew Breitbart in disguise. 6. Bho, “I am
just trying to buy time while I replace our military with the black panthers”.
7. Bill “dick” Maher paid me $ 1,000,000 to say it. 8. Bho just wanted to make
the Russian leader feel a Tingle up his leg. 10. Whoever let this recording out
is a RACIST and Acted stupidly”. 11 (Bonus) After the election I will be more
flexible because of the ass kicking I am going to get.
