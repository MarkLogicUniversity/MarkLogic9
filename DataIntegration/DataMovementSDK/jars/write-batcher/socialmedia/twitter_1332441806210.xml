Zimmerman had wet grass stains on his back, a Bleeding wound on the back of his head and a bloody nose.  Get it?  He was attacked from behind as he was walking back to his truck.  Zimmerman was not the aggressor.  He was simply following this kid in his vehicle.  Then when Travon took Off running, he got out briefly and looked for him.  There was a verbal confrontation, Zimmerman turned and walked toward his truck.  That&amp;#039;s when Trayvon jumped him like a little coward.   
 
He got exactly what he deserved.
