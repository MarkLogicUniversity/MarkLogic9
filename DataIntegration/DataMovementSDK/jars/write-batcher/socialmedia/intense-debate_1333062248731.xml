A poor white girl,Â  single mom with a baby,Â  probably from the sound of it still going to a few bars and spending her money on cigarettes perhaps...worried about paying for necessities,Â  putting her child in jeaporody and an icy road in front of her inÂ  a Cold world.Â Â  How is Hollie going to bring that home?Â  Well,Â  an actor can, but it is a hard role for her to relate to in anymore than a stereo type way... I'm not sure she's even driven through tiny poor white towns in the midwest on her own and had a chance to observe and contemplate the girls who live there,Â  and how a jacket she wears might be a weeks work.

Then on top of that, you bring religion in.Â Â  Perhaps the religion part could fit better at a pagent,Â  but we all have certain types of faith,Â  and unless she's in the habit as calling god by name in a Tim Teboe style excercise of faith, there just isn't going to be that "love of god" expressed in the chorus as it calls for to bring that song alive.Â Â  With some method  I suppose all is possible but that deep sort of transformation even of faith is a heck of a job to truly carry Off.

Just missing,Â  turns what can truly be a sublime expression of a very real human reality that exists for many young ladies in position of the girld in the song,Â  into just a pagent song.Â Â  Its the miss that makes it that way.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h0kkl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q17i</id></website><link>http://www.mjsbigblog.com/american-idol-11-top-9-vote-for-your-favorite-performance-poll.htm</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T02:24:17+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:03:41+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3qb09</id><link>http://www.mjsbigblog.com/american-idol-11-top-9-vote-for-your-favorite-performance-poll.htm#comment-479606822</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cs61</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
