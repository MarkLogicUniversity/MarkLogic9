When Mornidine was Â prescribed, it was not done to exploit women. Â Same with thalidomide. Â The fact was, these drugs had huge adverse affects on fetal development, something not known at that time.

We have made giant medical Strides since the 1940's and 1950's with drugs. Â We have also learned many things about fetal development and fetal development milestones, when each organ is formed, what medications are teratogenic and cause major fetal defects. Â 

Pipamazine was thought to be a long term relief for Morning sickness. Â Along with thalidomide, it turned out to be disastrous for many pregnancies.

If physicians had KNOWN the adverse affects of pipamazine, it would never have been marketed. Â The fact is, it worked. Â For what it was intended.

The advertising sucked - but ALL advertising in the 1940-1950's was pretty pathetic and very demeaning.
