But why has it taken until now to realise that the whole organisation has been badly run? There has been so much waste at the club it is unimaginable! Millions of dollars pi$$ed away on huge contracts for Bird, Prince, Idris and Zillman. Add to that the centre of excellence farce and it was pretty clear that that management hasn't been fit for purpose for some time. Also the growth of the Gold Coast is slowing due to the unaffordable property prices. Most of the new inhabitants are millionaires, tourists or Kiwi expats just passing through, it's hardly a place where families will flock in huge numbers. There are far more passionate and loyal rugby league heartlands that would support their club week-in week-out rather than turn up just when their team is going well. The Titans are a bunch of show ponies and the NRL is better Off without them. Give their Spot to central coast NSW or a second team in Brisbane.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hrvjj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tpar</id></website><link>http://www.loverugbyleague.com/blogpost_483-the-gold-coast-phoenix.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T11:43:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:00:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m344kd</id><link>http://www.loverugbyleague.com/blogpost_483-the-gold-coast-phoenix.html#comment-479554820</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ha4pq</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
