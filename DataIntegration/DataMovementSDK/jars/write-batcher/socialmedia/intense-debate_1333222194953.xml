The problem with Obama isn't the near $6 trillion in borrowing in just three years, the radical growth in the size of the federal government and its regulatory zeal, ObamaCare, the Boeing plant closure threat, the green jobs sweet-heart deals and Van Jones-like â€œMillions of Green Jobsâ€&#157; nonsense, the vast expansion in food stamps and unemployment pay-outs, the reversal of the Chrysler creditors, politically driven interference in the car industry, the failed efforts to get card check and cap and trade, the moratoria on new drilling in the Gulf, the general antipathy to new fossil fuel exploitation coupled with new finds of vast new reserves, the new financial regulations, an aggressive EPA oblivious to the effects of its advocacy on jobs, the threatened close-down of energy plants, the support for idling thousands of acres of irrigated farmland due to environmental regulations, the constant talk of higher taxes, the needlessly provocative rhetoric of â€œfat catâ€&#157;, â€œmillionaires and billionaires,â€&#157; â€œcorporate jet owners,â€&#157; etc. juxtaposed, in hypocritical fashion, to Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, Costa del Sol, and Vail First Family getaways, the 17 day Hawaiin vacation, not to mention gun running, oil spill Paralysis, black panther scandals, suing Arizona, on and on and on.

It was just announced that last monthâ€™s unemployment is still above 9% â€” despite the nearly five trillion dollars in Keynesian pump-priming, the near zero interest rates, the expanded unemployment and food stamp support, and the government takeovers and subsidies of businesses. There is a scary sort of deer-in-the-headlights look about Obama and Biden that is quite disturbing, as if they are thinking, â€œThis was not supposed to happened to us. Geithner, Goolsbee, Orszag, Romer, Summers assured us that all this borrowing would turn things around â€” but they are all gone or leaving, so now we are alone? What to do? Hmmm. More them/us class warfare rhetoric? Embrace more of the California/Illinois/New York blue-state model? More European Union emulation? A national high-speed rail jobs program? Bring back Van Jones and â€œmillions of green jobsâ€&#157;? Borrow another $5 trillion? Maybe negative interest rates? Seventy-five million on food stamps? Four years of unemployment insurance? A new Department of Jobs? Call in Jimmy Carter for advice about 1979? $100 billion more in green subsidies to progressive caring companies? Take over Ford? Another speech from Buffett? Unleash the Congressional Black Caucus?â€&#157; 

We have all heard ad nauseam that an eight-month-old Republican-controlled Congress has stopped Obamaâ€™s legislative agenda for three years.

No worries, all is well. Just keep whistling past the grave yard.
 
Ignore the polls, they are all wrong. 
Ignore the weekly unemployment numbers and the jobs numbers, they lie too. 
Ignore the repeated revisions, for the worse, to the weeks previous numbers. They are even bigger lies. 
Ignore the inflation numbers. Prices have not gone up. 
Ignore the despair you see around you. Those are jut upside down smiles. 
Ignore the constant vacations, on our dime, Barry indulges in. 
Ignore how he plays the average American, read the working stiff, as the fool. 
Ignore the trillions he has urinated away with no benefit at all to anyone but his pals. 
Ignore the blatant arrogance. 

And... 

Ignore the last two special elections. 

They are not warning alarms. His ship is not sinking. 
Nov 6th 2012 will be a landslide, You can bet the farm on that.  
And we will soon after be rid of this nightmare of incompetence and destruction. 
All will be well soon as he's long gone. 


Obamaâ€™s problem is itâ€™s not 2007 anymore. Obama is a known quantity now. Obama was elected based on a manufactured persona, a lie, put forward by the DNC and the fawning media. And who is Barack Hussein Obama? 

Obama is the 1st president in the history of the USA who is not a cultural American, and it shows. No other president, except Jimmy Carter, has ever run down his country to the world as Obama has. Obama has denigrated the people of America shamelessly, and he has no idea of who we are because he is not one of us. 

Obama was raised far outside of mainstream American culture. His upbringing was by socialists who indoctrinated him from day one to be a hardcore marxist ideologue. Obama was taught to loath the middle class and to use radical rules to attack it. Since before he was elected Obama has been tearing down the USA and the middle class which he fooled into voting for him. 

Obama was billed to be all things to all people. A pseudo-mythical messiah-like figure that rose mysteriously with no background yet was a towering intellect who could solve all our problems. Obama is a man of slogans, and was "going to hit the ground running", and "ready to lead on day one". He was going to be the post racial president who would unite the USA and lead us into a new  of enlightenment and renewed respect in the world of nations. Only now we know this all to be a farce. 

To those of us who took the time to investigate Obama while the fawning media failed to vette him it comes as no surprise that Obama is a failure. Anyone who tried to point out his radicalism, his criminal associates, terrorist friends, his racist church where he sat for 20 years listening to hatred of America and Americans was branded as a racist. It turns out that everything Sean Hannity reported about Obama's past was true. 

And now we know that Obama is a shallow self-serving man of little experience who constantly resorts to demagoguery of those who oppose his radical agenda. He makes denigrating generalizations of broad swathes of the population and makes it clear he is only the president of those who voted for him and support him. We are much worse Off as a nation than we were before Obama and have more than a year of this arrogant fool to endure. The best thing we can do is to vote out every democrat and take away any political power this "president" has. Let's all watch this impostor vacation and golf and travel the world in Air Force One at our expense while we continue without an inspirational leader and scratch our heads in wonder at the absurd Political Correctness that got us such a ludicrous president.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zjtz2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zmzu</id></website><link>http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/29/obamas-campaign-cash-haul-trailing-pace-of-08/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T01:45:51+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T21:21:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw48jb</id><link>http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/29/obamas-campaign-cash-haul-trailing-pace-of-08/#comment-481213570</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c9rkx</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
