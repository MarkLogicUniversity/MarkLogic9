William Walsham (1823-1897)
It is a thing most wonderful,almost too wonderful to be,that God's own Son should come from heaven,and die to save a child like me.And yet I know that it is true:he chose a poor and humble lot,and wept, and toiled, and mourned, and died,for love of those who loved him not.Â 
I cannot tell how he would lovea child so weak and full of sin;his love must be most wonderful,if he could die my love to win.I sometimes think about the cross,and shut my eyes, and try to seethe cruel nails and crown of thornsand Jesus crucified for me.But even could I see him die,I could but see a little partof that great love, which, like a fire,is Always Burning in his heart.It is most wonderful to knowhis love for me so free and sure;but 'tis more wonderful to seemy love for him so Faint and poor.And yet I want to love thee, Lord;O light the flame within my heart,and I will love thee more and more,until I see thee as thou art.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ewutv2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/n7i3</id></website><link>http://www.truthforlife.org/resources/sermon/the-arrest/</link><postedTime>2001-03-25T00:00:00+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:39:51+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m34gva</id><link>http://www.truthforlife.org/resources/sermon/the-arrest/#comment-479537425</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dwz7a</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2001-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
