I mean, take Drew Carey for example: This guy appeared in the WWF once and been apart of the Royal Rumble match and wasted space for an actual superstar that could have competed instead of himself. Drew didn't even fight, he just watched matt and jeff go at it, then when Kane goes after him, he eliminates himself like a idiot. So i guess that's how he got inducted into the WWE  of fame? by doing absolutely nothing but appearing in a WWE ring? Mean while a full time wrestler back then had really went into the business every night working their asses Off and never got inducted. That is just total BS. How the hell can a person who doesn't even work for the company be inducted like a few years later and the haven't Bled and sweated like a real full time Wrestler? I say Vince has "favorites" which is messed up.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zxfkj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dhf8</id></website><link>http://www.ewrestlingnews.com/news/3906/mike-tyson-credits-vince-mcmahon-for-taking-a-chance-on-him</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:28:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:58:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m33fmo</id><link>http://www.ewrestlingnews.com/news/3906/mike-tyson-credits-vince-mcmahon-for-taking-a-chance-on-him#comment-480262888</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lsvzr</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
