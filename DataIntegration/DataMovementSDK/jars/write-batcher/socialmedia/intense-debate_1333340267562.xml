With Bobby it's even less so because they didn't have the big, emotional send Off.Â  They had his final episode and intentionally left the ending up in the air, so they could go anywhere from there.Â  

I don't have a problem with that at all, and juding by the reactions I'm seeing here, the amount of people who do seem to be in the greator minority.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67qars</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/g6o1</id></website><link>http://www.spoilertv.com/2012/03/poll-what-did-you-think-of-supernatural_31.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:58:16+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T17:35:46+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw0q48</id><link>http://www.spoilertv.com/2012/03/poll-what-did-you-think-of-supernatural_31.html#comment-482028410</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6nhe1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
