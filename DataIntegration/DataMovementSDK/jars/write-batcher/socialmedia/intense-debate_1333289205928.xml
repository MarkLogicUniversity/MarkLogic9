America's birth came from diversity and in the beginning it was being spoon fed distortions of immoral humans. â€œWestern Civilizationâ€&#157; stayed at the shores of Europe. This is American Civilization. No one group would be better  without the other because America was never truly a "free world" until Civil Rights Era when both minority and white truly came together for a cause. So this idea that if it werenâ€™t for Europeans, America wouldnâ€™t be what it is, you are beyond wrong, in fact, you are living in a fantasy world carrying distorted views. Religion also has nothing to do with it. The true answer is human superiority: the idea of evil, where one believes his race, religion, or group is better than the other. They all encompass and one cannot overide the other. You can talk about all the explorations, but guess what you leave out. Natives and Blacks contributed in the maping those locations. But you wouldn't find that in a book.
Â  
Your notion of â€œintegratingâ€&#157; blacks into society is bull because blackâ€™s Bled for this country; sweated for this country, cried for this country, and slaved for thisÂ great country I call our American Beauty, it equally belongs to everyone because Europeans â€œsailedâ€&#157; to America just as blacks â€œsailedâ€&#157; here and every other immigrant â€œsailingâ€&#157; to the New World. Youâ€™re not racist thoughâ€¦No. You are a cynical angry human being that carries deep resentment towards different races and religious groups. 

Here is a life lesson for you on the Black American Founders of America.
