Mash had 20 lbs on Barnes and was a sophisticated ball handler and passer, neither of which are strong suits for Barnes.

Both were deadly jump shooters but Mash possessed a superior post game as well and would often fire his fade away on the low block. Barnes doesnt seem to have that in his arsenal and shoots the majority of his jumpers from Spot ups or  the dribble.

The best comparison I've seen is Wally Szczerbiak, a good complementary player who even made an allstar team one year but was Always limited to role player status by his inability to create his own shot.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z9pc3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnei</id></website><link>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/29/3137502.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T01:04:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T06:59:10+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3032c</id><link>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/29/3137502.html#comment-480366291</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzpba</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
