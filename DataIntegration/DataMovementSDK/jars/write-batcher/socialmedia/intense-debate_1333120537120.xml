Both have said that the 2nd does not allow private citizens to carry guns, as has four justices on the Supreme court. Â  They are all in clear violation of their oath of office to defend and protect the Constitution. Â they are in clear violation of the second amendment which they turned their backs on. My first paragraph is as clear as a bell

The Heller v Wash DC and McDonald v Chicago rulings were meant for theÂ ENTIREÂ nation not just a fewÂ chosen Spots,Â Â but yet we haveÂ city'sÂ and states that have chosen to go their own way ANDÂ disregard the second amendment and that of the high court. Â In reality, I should be able to travel from coast to coast with my glock and back again unimpeded, Â but thats only in principle to some states who are still in violation of the 2nd amendment to theÂ Constitution.

As for the rest of my garbage post, I make noÂ apology'sÂ expressed or implied.Â Â Â Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h72x6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnd7</id></website><link>http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2012/03/28/1882609/state-of-apathy.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T14:32:28+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:33:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3k404</id><link>http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2012/03/28/1882609/state-of-apathy.html#comment-480161502</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5449i</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
