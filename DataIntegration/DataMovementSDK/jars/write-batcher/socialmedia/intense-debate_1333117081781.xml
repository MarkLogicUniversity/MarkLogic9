But what about Cate Blanchett? I know she's young, but the you'd be surprised at what the make-up department can do (look at Effie!). She has the piercing, kinda squinty eyes and the bone structure that I imagined Coin has, and I think with a pin-straight wig she would look perfect (I actually pictured Coin as one of those perfect-looking old women in the rejuvenating makeup commercials). Her look and performance as the Soviet in Indiana Jones/ Crystal Skull puts her high on my list of candidates. (No doubt she has the  skills to pull Off the Cold, calculating Coin.)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zzqyj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/z4az</id></website><link>http://www.hypable.com/2012/03/29/meryl-streep-for-president-coin/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:13:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:27:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31w0s</id><link>http://www.hypable.com/2012/03/29/meryl-streep-for-president-coin/#comment-479855660</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
