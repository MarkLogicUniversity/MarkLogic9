Why have a larger woman be the one who freaks out over the donuts? That's a bit insensitive and stereotypical! Second, I do think something like a "Headache" will turn into a brain Bleed or something for CJ. Anyway, I do think that Denise's judgement is being clouded because of the longtime friendship. But her friendship with Jackie goes back before Jackie was in the position she's in now. And Denise can't see that she is being played. I don't like how Jackie is pitting all the friends up against each other.....her line of defense, that when there's strength in numbers, you can't go places. Break apart that defense, and Jackie will go straight to the top. I think Denise is gonna use that Kosovo card. I was Always a bit taken aback by the way Roxy dressed too, but that's who she is. I was an Army Wife too at one point. But my ex husband was only an E4. I still had to dress appropriately. So should the wives on the show.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lamh9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4cck</id></website><link>http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/node/62934</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:17:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:59:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m344dq</id><link>http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/node/62934#comment-479554003</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hs319</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
