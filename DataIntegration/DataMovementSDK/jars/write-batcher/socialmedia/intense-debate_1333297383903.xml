1.Go for some raw food like salad ,sprouts etc..This will help boosting one,s health too and helps reducing global warming. one can understand if every house-hold skips cooking of one meal a day the amount of reduction in emission of carbon will be enormous.
2. balance use of current as well as gas by using micro oven etc. so that your current bill also fits to lowest tariff bracket.
3. Do not leave place until food is cooked to need as otherwise there is every possibility of vessel being Burnt, food spilled resulting in a situation to recook causing double waste.
4. do not use thickÂ utensilsÂ that takes more time to Heat up and also more of waste in cooling too.
5. Light up burner only when you are fully prepared to cook. Most of the time burner is lit and left until vessels are searched.
6.duly switch Off the Gas connection once cooking is over to obviate/save leakage.
7. User pressure cookers etc. and also strictly use lids to consereve Heat and avoid waste.
