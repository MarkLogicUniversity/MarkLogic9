If they don't make the play  this year, I can see them trying to shake that team up a little bit. Some one on their team will beÂ available. If we could snatch Marleu or Thorton from them, it would be great. You send Bozak and a 1st or something like that back the other way.Â 

Lupul - Thorton - Kessel
Kadri - Grabovski - Kulemin
Frattin - Colborne - XX

Sorry for the randomness but I was just looking at the standings, and SJ has been struggling and might not make it into the play Off. So many years of not being able to go all the way, you got to think they would shake up their core. We get the home-town boy, who's got the size we need in our top6, the perfect disher for Kessel, and he's that veteran leader. I think it's a match made in heaven for us. He can also mentor Colborne to become a player in his mold. You can send SJ Bozak, Mac, + a pick. You let Kadri take over Mac's Spot.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6y4x82</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/v4x4</id></website><link>http://mapleleafshotstove.com/2012/03/22/confidential-hbos-leafs-wings-247-spoilers/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T13:38:13+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:40:08+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi5i9x</id><link>http://mapleleafshotstove.com/2012/03/22/confidential-hbos-leafs-wings-247-spoilers/#comment-473878173</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/d2bc3</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
