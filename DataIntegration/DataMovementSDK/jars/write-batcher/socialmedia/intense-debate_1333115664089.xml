I wouldn't doubt that Trayvon provoked Zimmerman to a fit of rage, which resulted in him pulling the trigger in the Heat of the moment after he lost his temper when this gangsta wannabe pushed him over the edge. Nobody just pulls a gun on someone without a major influence causing them to do so. From what it seems, Trayvon was a punk that provoked Zimmerman to pull the trigger after what probably resulted in pushing Zimmerman past the boiling point from aggressively provoking him. If anyone has ever seen the movie "Flatliners" watch the segment with the little black girl telling Off someone with a relentless slew of swearing and punking an individual. That reminds me of what probably caused Zimmerman to lose it.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ztisx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/killzimmerman-twitter-advocates-violence-against-martins-killer/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:41:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:13:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31uhf</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/killzimmerman-twitter-advocates-violence-against-martins-killer/#comment-479840605</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8xvax</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
