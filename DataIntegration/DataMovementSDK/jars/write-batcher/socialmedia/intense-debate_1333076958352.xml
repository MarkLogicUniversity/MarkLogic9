Bring in a decent tender a couple of veterans and this team would have played out of their funk, it may still have cost us that elusive Spot but I believe they would of been out early enough to still be pushing. Fuck the pressure of the worlds largest hockey market must have scared the shit out these kids. I think its a manageable mistake but a big mistake none the less, not to even bring up half the players not living up to expectation or even close to expectations is not the way I see this team moving forward, I can not see this happening again in the near future. But again who would even predict things could get this tough on any team should play the lottery three fold. I can see a few moves in the Off season and maybe a trade request or two.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zru2m</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/v4x4</id></website><link>http://mapleleafshotstove.com/2012/03/29/329-marlies-this-week/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:00:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:16:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3uhfh</id><link>http://mapleleafshotstove.com/2012/03/29/329-marlies-this-week/#comment-479781409</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/m9i0b</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
