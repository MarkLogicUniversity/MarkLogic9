Those are just the conclusions that I have come to. I guess I should have refrained from responding on the Calvinism thingy. Anyway, don't wory about giving me hope. I've found a solution to the "existential problem." One thing that has helped me out is coming to see that life and death are intertwined and not separate. If I'm afraid of death then I'm afraid of life. When I embrace death I embrace life. I now accept the fact that I have only so much time to live and that life involves pain and separation. By embracing this I embrace life itself and accept everything about it. Depending on a belief in an afterlife or drowning myself in the moment to avoid pain is to despise reality, which is to despise life itself. What matters to me now is to live my days well and as fully as possible. I am converting the terrified, denial-type relationship to death into something active and positive as I am released from Anxieties and fearful responses by embracing death and not repressing it.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/672hs0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/m7z5</id></website><link>http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2012/03/new-apologetics.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T09:56:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T19:45:20+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwvc4z</id><link>http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2012/03/new-apologetics.html#comment-481121222</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/59byr</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
