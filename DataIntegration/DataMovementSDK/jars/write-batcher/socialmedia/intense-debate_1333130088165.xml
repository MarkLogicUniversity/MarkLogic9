I don' care what you think of her, she is Spot on here.  The left uses mob tactics and violence to intimidate their opposition.  The old school lefties used hanging and shooting squads, the new gang uses regulations and Executive orders but the end is the same - crush all dissent and cement your power.

If we are to survive as option #1 above, we, the People, are going to have to take on the mob.  Not returning violence with violence, not  on our (laughable) DOJ to protect our God-given civil rights, but with reason, numbers, sanity.  There are more of us than there are of them.  The lefties Always end up eating their own if you give them enough time.  The trick is to outlast them and undermine their means of support.
