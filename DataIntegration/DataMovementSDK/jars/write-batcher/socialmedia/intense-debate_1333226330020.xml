If Cutch gets some solid protection WATCH OUT! because this will be a "break out" year, He could explode! I am big on Presley in the lead Off Spot! I If hes got presley at say .298 in front of him and Tabata .277 in front of him we will score some runs, We just need that solid protection from someone!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67lxdv</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27754918%26vkey=news_pit%26c_id=pit</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T19:56:21+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T21:46:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw4nb4</id><link>http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27754918%26vkey=news_pit%26c_id=pit#comment-481236714</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hyjnx</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
