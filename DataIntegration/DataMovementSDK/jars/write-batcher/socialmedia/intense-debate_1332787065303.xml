The Dear Author articles aren't hit pieces, but show that while Ms. James insists that the fanfiction was reworked substantially that only the names were changed. The existing typographical, grammar and plot issues remain very much intact. Ms. James and her "publisher" crassly rushed this to market to capitalize on her mini-fandom, then papered the hell out of outlets to get coverage.

Let's not even discuss the nature of her hero - he's a flat out abuser. The BDSM elements violate every rule when it comes to safe, sane and consensual play, and it portrays BDSM as unhealthy and wrong. Her heroine is an insipid, stupid and selfish child who constantly Faints in the hero's arms or uses his past against him. Terrible plot, terrible character development, and terrible writing are what "Fifty Shades" is, and many of us in the Twi fandom are truly embarrassed that this is the fic that puts us on the map. 

There are far better writers in the Twi fandom who deserve this success - Debra Anastasia and Jennifer DeLucy are a few. Unfortunately this poorly written and poorly edited soap opera that was "published" to line James' and TWCS' pockets Gains fame. It's a truly sad day for our fandom. 

On the other end of this is the growing number of our writers leaving our community, either pulling published and WIP fics in the hopes of becoming the next E L James, or out of disgust for the now mercenary attitude of some writers. Some have, in fact, posted that if you want to know the end to their story you have to "buy the book". What makes a fandom work is the respect and trust that the writers and readers have for one another. James and TWCS have betrayed this, and many of us fear this will destroy the fandom we love so much. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/666hpn</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zq49</id></website><link>http://www.themarysue.com/50-shades-of-grey-and-the-twilight-pro-fic-phenomenon/</link><postedTime>2012-03-23T16:28:03+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:31:55+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk9794</id><link>http://www.themarysue.com/50-shades-of-grey-and-the-twilight-pro-fic-phenomenon/#comment-476564778</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ypl7</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-23</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
