But wait, I have found a cure.  It's a rather intensive program, guaranteed to work.  It is a .45 step process delivered all at one time.   This program has proven over time to work, not like those hokey pokey head shrinks that say you're healed.  I would like to take this opportunity to say, "I would take this heavy burden of rehabilitation upon myself, and treat it with the utmost care it deserves".  
IF ONLY THE WORLD THOUGHT THIS WAY, INSTEAD OF BEING A BUNCH OF BLEEDING HEARTS THAT THINK EVERYONE IS A PERSON.  THESE ANIMALS, THAT TOUCH KIDS ARE NOT PEOPLE.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67izvr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/8nml</id></website><link>http://click2houston.preview.ib-prod.com/pns/servlet/page/view/pns-hou/news/-/1735978/9913796/-/tv82yaz/-/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:03:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T15:09:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwsklx</id><link>http://click2houston.preview.ib-prod.com/pns/servlet/page/view/pns-hou/news/-/1735978/9913796/-/tv82yaz/-/index.html#comment-481903797</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/aeoaz</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
