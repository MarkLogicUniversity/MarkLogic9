Â 
911 Call #3Â  audio shows that from the time this 911 call was received for approximately the next 45 seconds repeated audible cries can be heard in the background.Â Â  During the conversation with the 911 operator, the female caller describes someone â€œscreaming outsideâ€&#157;. She indicates that she believes the person is yelling for help, but she does not know why.Â  At about :45 into the call,Â  a loud noise can be heard and the caller indicates she has just heard a single gunshot.Â  After this point, the screams stop and do not continue.Â  It must be surmised that the screaming that the woman heard began at some point before her call to 911. 
Â 
Officer Timothy Smith (from preliminary police report dated 27 Feb 12 at 0329 hrs):Â  Officer Smith responded to a report of a suspicious person at about 1917 hours.Â  As he was arriving, he received transmissions that gunshots had been fired in the same subdivision.Â  According to Officer Smith, â€œI asked the subject in the red jacket, later identified as George Zimmerman (who was original caller for the suspicious person complaint), if he had seen the subject.Â  Zimmerman stated that he had shot the subject and was still armed.Â  Zimmerman complied with all my verbal commands and was secured in handcuffs.Â  Located on the inside of Zimmermanâ€™s waistband, I removed a black Kel Tek 9mm semi automatic handgun and holster. While I was in such close contact with Zimmerman, I could observe that his back appeared to be wet and was covered in grass, as if he had been lying on his back on the ground.Â  Zimmerman was also Bleeding from the nose and back of his headâ€¦.Zimmerman was placed in the rear of my police vehicle and was given first aid by the SFD.Â  While the SFD was attending to Zimmerman, I overheard him state â€˜I was yelling for someone to help me, but no one would help me.â€™Â  At no point did I question Zimmerman about the incident that had taken place.Â  Once Zimmerman was cleared by the SFD, he was transported to the Sanford Police Department.â€&#157;
â€œJohnâ€&#157; in interview on 27 Feb by Tampa Bay FOX News affiliate: Â â€œThe guy on the bottom, who I believe had a red sweater on, was yelling to me, â€˜Help.Â  Help.â€™ I told him to stop and I was calling 911â€&#157;â€¦.â€&#157;and then when I got upstairs and looked down, the person that was on top, beating up the other guy, was the one laying in the grass, and I believe he was dead at that point.â€&#157;
Â 
Girlfriend of Trayvon Martin, from recording of her comments:Â  â€œHe said this man was watching him, so he put his hoodie on.Â  He said he lost the man.Â  I asked Trayvon to run, and he said he was going to walk fast.Â  I told him to run, but he said he was not going to run.â€&#157;â€¦.â€&#157;Trayvon said, â€˜What are you following me for,â€™ and the man said â€˜What are you doing here.â€™Â  Next thing I hear is somebody pushing, and somebody pushed Trayvon because the head set just fell.Â  I called him again and he didnâ€™t answer the phone.â€&#157;

Conclusion:Â  Trayvon Martin attacked George Zimmerman, and after nearly a minute - perhaps longer - of crying out for help, Zimmerman used justifiable deadly force and took Trayvon Martin's life.Â  A tragedy any way you look at it, but not a criminal Act by Zimmerman.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zcxr4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:16:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:15:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3tju8</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-479519534</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ecsyd</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
