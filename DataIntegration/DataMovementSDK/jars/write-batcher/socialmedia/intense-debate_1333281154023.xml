Hm.... 

I work in the pet department at my walmart. Do you have any idea how many random things from the store I find stashed behind dog food or the wrong item in the wrong Spots, not because ONLY employees do it, but because people put crap wherever they want. The employee should've known better, however so should the person using the coupon.

The fault is on both, the employees (the person you asked and the cashier that allowed the coupon to go through) and the customer. Both should know better if they read the coupon.

If her walmart allows things like this, then thats fine and fair to her, different walmarts have different rules. However after they send the coupons  for the money back, I wouldn't try to do it again for the simple fact Depending on how many people will be able to do this they'll be losing money. All those $.94 add up.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67qlnd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/txtv</id></website><link>http://thekrazycouponlady.com/the-bragging-lounge/all-this-for-8-16/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:16:44+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T05:04:52+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwfrad</id><link>http://thekrazycouponlady.com/the-bragging-lounge/all-this-for-8-16/#comment-481550876</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6yyua</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
