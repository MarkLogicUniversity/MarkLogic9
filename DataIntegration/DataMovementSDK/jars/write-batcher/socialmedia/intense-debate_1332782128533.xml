However for some people this is not as easy as it should be, people sometimes forget and lights are left Burning for hours. Motion sensors can help remedy this, by attaching the light to a motion sensor you can Ensure the light only comes on while there is movement in the room. This is a great way to control your home lighting in rooms where you are moving around a lot or in the room for a short time. Kitchens and bathrooms could be good candidates for this.
