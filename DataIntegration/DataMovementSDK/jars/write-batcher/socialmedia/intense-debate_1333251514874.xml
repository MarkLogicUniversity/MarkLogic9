The origins of your mascot ARE disgusting. How any of you can justify it and yet call Mizzou people "slavers" when obviously no one is around now that ever took part in such Acts. Of course, you all forget that kansas being a "free state" meant they didn't want ANY blacks, free or slave, in the state at all. You conveniently forget those facts. And you all rewrite your state history when it the attack on lawrence was in retaliation for the Burning of Osceola, Missouri. Read a book sometime. A fact-based book.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zpkth</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmb</id></website><link>http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/29/3523500/we-shouldnt-rush-to-bring-back.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:09:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T00:11:39+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwn0oa</id><link>http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/29/3523500/we-shouldnt-rush-to-bring-back.html#comment-481349665</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/851yq</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
