It's pretty neat that the engines were found, but as a past employee of Amazon.com I wonder why his fullfillment centers are sweat shops where the employees work in severe Heat conditions, the Campbellsville KYÂ center often Reaches temperatures of 120 degrees in the summer with only fans to move the Heat around.
