With the exception of Hades and Neptune all of them are Spot on, and both Volcano and Amor are just perfect.

Furthermore, Wonder woman is as  a great character and it is so satisfying to see a superhero actuall be wrong for once, even if it was obvious that she was wrong from the get-go. 

Every single issue of this series disappoints because it is ultimately  too short, I Always read them too fast and want to know more and am excited to see which god they intend to tackle next. For once both the world and the characters are perfect in a comic book and I will gladly say that this issue is a step up from the confusion of #6. 

9.0 - I simply can't find flaws with this comic, even if it does not shatter the roof and earn a 10 from me like Penguin did :)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yeax1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7d9s</id></website><link>http://comics.ign.com/articles/122/1221325p1.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T01:19:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T16:42:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwwna0</id><link>http://comics.ign.com/articles/122/1221325p1.html#comment-481982471</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/epowu</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
