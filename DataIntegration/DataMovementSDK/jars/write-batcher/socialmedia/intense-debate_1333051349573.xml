be prepared to invest some time. The buses leave for 7 p.m. games at 
least two hours before the first pitch, and some won’t return home until
 after midnight."  Anyone leaving from the north say West Palm will be 
driving at the same speed and take the same time as the bus ..Everyone 
will be investing ,our customers just won't have to deal with the 
Headache. Conversely a game starting at 7 ending at 10 an average game 
length,  90% of the customers will be home well before midnight..sure 
PSL will be a longer ride to and fro but that is not unique to the bus 
as the article seems to indicate. It is the same commute / time for 
everyone. It just Depends where you live. And finally we are trying to 
find a way to lower the prices even more so that for the bronze level 
games from Broward for example the ride and ticket will be under $50 
bucks.That's arguably a lot less than driving, gas and parking and less 
stressful for sure. The full link to see what the bus is all about is
