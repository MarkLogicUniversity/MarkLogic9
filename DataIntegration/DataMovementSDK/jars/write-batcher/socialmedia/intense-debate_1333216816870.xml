No! The violence you cited is evidence enough that Rush's silly antics in the House chamber played a functional role in the malevolence shown from one race toward other races, or from one group of ideologists toward another group of ideologists. Take your pick. Rush's hoodie performance was intentional encouragement for his brother Black Panthers, for blacks everywhere, and for all other anti-Americans, to ratchet up their Acts of violence.  Blacks have been Itching for this ever since the 1970's. 

P.S. Why are there still white and/or conservatives (here and abroad) voicing shock and disappointment that the black Muslim U.S. president is fueling anti-American activities on the soil of the Republic which he swore to protect? Well .... when he is re-elected in November and then begins to cut loose with the final actions to extinguish our Republic and Constitution, maybe then youall will get the point.
