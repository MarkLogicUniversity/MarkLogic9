This, naturally, goes down like a plate of Cold sick. Moderators where stepping in to  no criticism of Carloine Lucas would see the light of day.

One supported of Lucas, a constituent and fan of her work, told me she looked forward to my 'lamp post day'. I suppose this is when the glorious green revolution happens. Charming!

And all because I dont agree with the Guardian 'consensus'. They like to paint us as the nasty ones, but all I want to happen to my political opponents is for the to just b8gger  and stop interfering in my life.
