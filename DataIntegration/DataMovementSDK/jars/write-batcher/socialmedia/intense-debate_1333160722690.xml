Predators and Preys must live together, and the Preys can still be happy (sustaining the lives of those who "prey" on them) if such preys remain aware of what they're doing, and decide that they don't mind. On the other hand, as soon as those preys ponder their dilemma and decide that they no longer prefer that position, then all that is needed to â€œBe Who They Prefer To Beâ€&#157; is just the maintenance of that clear awareness in their minds. They simply need to remember at all times, that it is their right to change whenever thy decide. It matters not what we were yesterday, yesteryear of the last moment, all that matters is who we decide to be, from this moment on. 

For whatever reason, too many black persons however, have been stuck with the most damaging programming against ourselves, unable to see that all that is required is for us to decide that we no longer intend to be anyone's "choice prey". Once that is clear in more black minds, then those who prey on us will be compelled to find other preys to sustain their feelings of superiority, if they don't intend to work from inside to develop true superiority from inside, instead of maintaining the false superiority, which by default necessitates a constant commission of crimes on others, in order for that false state to remain. 

So I am not a black person who thinks getting white people to change a few laws is going to stop racist white persons from projecting their own: guilt, Anxieties, insecurities, lies, disowning and denying their ancestors wrongdoing, while over-praising the credits they did earn, with the unacknowledged free labor of blacks. I am fully aware, that racist person are constantly going to continue projecting all of those feelings on black people; in the form of claiming that black people need to be feared and controlled. All of their important books are already there to support their claims. Dictionaries have long taught everyone that Blacks are: Evil, Wicked, Cursed, Without Morals and Worthy of Discrimination, while Bibles have subtly suggested that the black race is cursed. Such universally instituted programming still influences the collective consciousness/psychic of every one - every day. With excessive and crippling God-fearing disallowing â€œusâ€&#157; black people from breakin-away.

Only blatant racist wrongs as Trayvon's death can mobilize people every now and then to inch their   way out of the divine trance that have us working against our own best interest.  (In which we atch our youths committing suicide in the form of Black On Black Crimes, because too many simply cannot take the constant pressures of Living While Black). And while the majority of white people are not conscious racist, racism has been institutionalized to work on Auto Pilot, so that whites cannot help benefiting from it, and blacks cannot avoid its impact no matter how much wealth and degrees any of us attain. None of such OUTSIDE THINGS will replace the inner work that black people collectively MUST DO! Consequently, just as in the days of slavery, when those really profiting from slavery were relatively few, but they got the majority of whites to enforce slavery (against their own best interest) so too, itâ€™s not the majority of white people who currently want to maintain a Universal System of White Supremacy Racism, but the few who do, are still fooling the majority that they're especially superior to blacks. And humans being what we are, crave that kind of EGO BOOST; thus mindlessly endorse a situation that is just as against their own best interest today, as it was when their ancestors in the days of slavery were also fooled.

I took the time to explain, that I wasn't saying that Zimmerman's father being a Judge; automatically used the law to persecute black people. Yet, you turn right around and said that that is what I said. So cut and paste where I gave the impression that "he MUST have maligned other black men"? But, in any case; now that you've displayed your ability and need to say what I clearly DID NOT SAY, in order to strengthen your position; let me accept that Zimmerman was the calm, cool, intelligent and collected person as you want him to be. Let's assume that he came from a "Good White Father &amp; Good Hispanic Mother" who taught him a lot of GOOD LESSONS about Life and Living. That Good Father (being a Judge), and having influenced his son correctly, one would imagine still has some influence and contact with his son? Is that not a reasonable assumption to make? And being a Judge, and knowing that so many protocols were ignored on the scene of the crime (as if a DOG, and not a human was killed) that father should know that his son is in a Jurisdiction where he'll be protected by the authorities. Isn't that another fair assumption? So why has that father not encouraged his son to turn himself in, and allow the process of the law to take its place? Does the Judge not know more than anyone else that such a person is innocent until proven guilty? Why therefore hasn't he talked his son into doing the right thing?

So let us now surrender in the realization that you have you position, and I have mine. It is not necessary for us to argue about this situation anymore, because every point that I have offered were points that I have been commenting on, ever since I started commenting on the internet. The situations change, and the wording change, but my fundamental message is the same. In my small way I have been saying to any black people who cares to listen, to understand that the great wrong that was done to our ancestors is too monstrous for any people to accept. We the "real blacks" find it hard to accept that our ancestors also choose to live through such brutality and indignities for so many centuries, instead of deciding like the early Colonists of the U.S., who said to their British kin, "give us Liberty, or give us death!" 

That is my message to anyone who will listen. Everyone is already an eternal entity. We do not need to please or appease any race-specific, or gender-specific God to grant us eternal life, especially when that God is of the Image of the people who enslaved our ancestors, and taught our ancestors to be good slaves to make the enslavers wealthy and happy, while we lingered as Cursed people are supposed to be; deserving of the cursed position as God's Will. That is a programmed hypnosis that still has black people worldwide entranced. For the most part many of us are still compelled by Meritorious Manumissions tactics and feelings without the least clue, that itâ€™s we who're allowing ourselves to still be corrupted and condemned by White Supremacy Racism that has infused and compromised every aspect of our lives. As Neely Fuller said, â€œwithout understanding the Universal System of White Supremacy Racism, everything else that we think we understand will be confusedâ€&#157;.

So as I said, Trayvon has done a great value to black people. And from that perspective, â€œFrom this moment onwards it doesn't matter if Zimmerman serves the time he HAS EARNED, or if he walksâ€&#157;. Trayvon is already dead and nothing will bring him back. And maybe if Zimmerman walks, it will completely push those black persons on the sidelines to be on the right side. You have helped me to see that no matter what happens TRAYVON has done an enormous good to black people. You did that by making me see that thereâ€™ll still be blacks who will be just as adamant as racist whites about the inability of young black men to be right, no matter how right they are.

Yes Black On Black Crimes will continue and not get the attention that this one got, because all of the right elements had to come together for the MYSTIC IMPACT to come through. It had to happen so that all REASONABLE people could know without a shadow doubt that TRAYVON was murdered by a vigilante who was tired of black people " getting away" as he clearly stated on the tape. If there was even a shred of doubt in reasonable minds, the momentum it has built wouldn't have come about. So I am one of those persons who has no doubt in my mind, that Trayvon was minding his own business when he was STALKED, ACCOSTED, &amp; MURDERED by a COLD-BLOODED VIGILANTE, and that's the way it had to be. Maybe I should join you in in seeing Zimmerman as the victim here. Since; after-all, I now see that MYSTIC forces had drawn him into a situation to provide to perfectly execute the degree of wrongs to push those black persons over the edge, who were still sitting on the sidelines, unable to see that Black On Black Crimes is the effect of incessant: profiling, scrutinizing and psychological warfare imposed on young black males. 

Try as you may, the  HAS TURNED, and there's nothing else you can do to turn it back. Last night after my correspondence with you I saw Zimmerman's black friend on TV and realized that Zimmerman has given into heavy drinking even before the incident, so my guess about him drinking to live with himself, was not so baseless at all. And since he didn't learn to reduce or remove painful feelings without the use of mind-numbing substances, I am sure that he'll only get worse, then those harboring him, may soon not see that obligation as so good for their own sanity, after all. In any case, he made his bed, and now I hope heâ€™s enjoying it, consistent to the enjoyment that Trayvonâ€™s parents now have.
The bed that Iâ€™ve made is making it my business to do what I can (in my small way) to remind black people that we can only be oppressed, hunted down and killed, if we continue to hold onto the same mindset, that was introduced to our ancestors to make them love those who made laws, to compel them to love slaveholders and white skin, more than they loved themselves. Again I say; Trayvon has won! It is your business and right to make Zimmerman out into whatever you want him to be. Victim or Hero I don't care Damn. Trayvon has won!! Trayvon has won!! Trayvon has won!! His transition in this last incarnation has Propelled him to heights that he probably would not have attained, if Zimmerman had allowed him to die in an ordinary way. Trayvon has won!! Amen!!
