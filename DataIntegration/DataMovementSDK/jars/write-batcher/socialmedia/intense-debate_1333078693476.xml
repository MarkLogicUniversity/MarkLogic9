This is, indeed, inventing memory.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just think of all the actions your body does in a day. There are simply too many to even conceive, from pumping blood, digesting and breathing to scratching you leg, driving to work, arguing with your boss, making a sandwich and playing a game of tennis. Every second you are moving, doing and thinking. Our brains are amazing things that can regulate, operate and coordinate all of these things, every second of our lives, until at last they give up, knackered. I find this monumental task quite breathtaking. Many of these incredible duties may well be misinterpreted as being consciously willed. Is it the case, then, that we actually ascribe conscious will to actions that are not consciously willed?Â  Is there a prevalence for humans to find a reason for doing things?



There are certainly cases where we can observe this sort of thing happening. For example, our good friend Daniel Wegner (2002) talks of posthypnotic suggestions, whereby a hypnotist will ask the hypnotised person to do a particular action upon the end of the hypnosis (along the lines of â€œWhen I click my fingers three times, you will wake up andâ€¦â€&#157;). There are some varying reactions to people finding themselves doing certain actions while newly back in the world of conscious will and reality. The interesting observations made by Albert Moll, a late 18th century German expert in hypnotism and, erâ€¦ sexology[1], show
how these people can, post facto, overlay conscious will onto unconsciously willed actions. One of the more exuberant explanations given to Moll is reported in Wegner (2002, p.150):


Â 


I tell a hypnotised subject that when he wakes he is to take a flower-pot from the window, wrap it in cloth, put it on the sofa, and bow to it three times. All which he does. When he is asked for his reasons he answers, â€œYou know, when I woke and saw the flower-pot there I thought that it was rather Cold the flower-pot had better be warmed a little, or else the plant would die [sic]. So I wrapped it in the cloth, and then I thought that as the sofa was near the fire I would put the flower-pot on it; and I bowed because I was pleased with myself for having such a bright idea.â€&#157;Â  He added that he did not consider the proceeding foolish, [because] he had told me his reasons for so .

(Moll 1889, p.153-154)


Â 


This is a fascinating example of someone creating a reason for completing an action after they had completed the action so as to make the whole process make sense â€“ the ascribing of intention to an action after the action has been started or completed. 










[1] I wonder what form practical experiments take in this disciplineâ€¦

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and then
&lt;blockquote&gt;

The third conception about the invention of will can be seen in how the left and right hemispheres work in our brains. Our different hemispheres control different things in everything we do, see and perceive. This would be, for example, the left hand side controlling the right visual field and vice versa. Some research has been done into people who, for medical reasons, have had the left and right hemispheres fully or partially severed from each other (ouch). Most verbal responses are produced in the left brain, and the right brain does not normally produce speech. In this area, there is research that reports[1] that a patient was shown in the left visual field, thus right brain, the word â€œlaughâ€&#157; and he would often laugh. When asked why, his left brain would kick in and â€˜make-upâ€™ a reason as to why the right brain had made him laugh â€“ â€œYou guys come up and test us every month. What a way to make a livingâ€&#157;. The word â€œwalkâ€&#157; shown to the right brain would make the patient get up and leave. Upon being asked why, he answered, â€œIâ€™m going into the house [from the testing van] to get a â€&#157;. This is one of several such examples of left to right brain interaction that leads to the invention of intention.

So what does this tell us?Â  This shows us quite clearly that, as Wegner so eloquently says:

Â 

The person who views actions as plausibly caused by the conscious will must necessarily complete the puzzle whenever parts are missing. Imagining oneself as a conscious agent means that conscious intention, action, and will must each be in place for every action. Intention and action imply will; intention and will imply action; and action and will imply intention. An ideal agent has all three. Putting these parts in place, it seems, involves constructing all the distortion of reality to accommodate the birth of the ego.

(Wegner 2002, p.186)

Â 

So whenever we are lacking one of the pieces of the jigsaw, then our brains seem to necessarily fill it in with a constructed piece, or distorted piece. Even actions can be distorted, as discussed through memory, but also through bias. The last time I
went to a football match, my Shouting at the referee for awarding a free kick against my team was not an identical interpretation of the action to what an opposing fan thought of it. The game I watched was, indeed, a different game, in many senses, to the game seen by a fan of the other team. Two people have their brains inventing different aspects of the same visual phenomena.
