We have the most ignorant, unapologetic and yes-mentally retarded drivers I have ever seen in a city. I now just assume everyone who is driving around me is not beyond cutting me Off or driving themselves into a brick wall. Â Also, I agree with the others on the left lane. If you are going slower, stay out of it! I notice in busy times there'll be a car going 59 in a 60 zone in the left lane with a huge group stuck behind him/her which actually just makes our morning traffic worse. And I 100% agree with the yellowhead issue, huge trucks in all 3 lanes makes it more dangerous for everyone else.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/g049uf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7maa</id></website><link>http://www.edmontonsun.com/2011/07/18/alberta-has-most-annoyed-drivers-2</link><postedTime>2011-07-19T01:13:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-07-19T14:40:31+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/5ye83p</id><link>http://www.edmontonsun.com/2011/07/18/alberta-has-most-annoyed-drivers-2#comment-257264993</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gn397</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-07-19</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
