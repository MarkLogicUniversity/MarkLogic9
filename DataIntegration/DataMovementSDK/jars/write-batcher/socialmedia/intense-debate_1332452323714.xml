You could also say the same thing about movies, and book...

And you can't blame video games for theÂ aggressivenessÂ people had over thousands of years. As in, if there's some psycho maniac who goes and starts shooting innocent, (or not), people, if he gamed, it's notÂ necessarily, (if at all), related.

Because some people keep going on about how said-people played before going on a shoot-out, and it doesn't make sense, as such violence has been there for plenty of years.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yuk0v</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/60u7</id></website><link>http://www.ign.com/blogs/angrymrbungle/2012/03/22/video-games-lead-to-aggressive-behavior/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:46:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:46:26+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi5wl5</id><link>http://www.ign.com/blogs/angrymrbungle/2012/03/22/video-games-lead-to-aggressive-behavior/#comment-473882836</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gsel8</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
