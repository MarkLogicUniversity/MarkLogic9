     The shift may be due in large part to Christians finding RLP, but secondarily it may be due to some of us (Cough) getting a bit more self-awareness and realizing that as Scott says, people type faster than they think. Also, some of us (Cough) have learned that it's never good to communicate online before that first cuppa joe in the AM.
     So...I thought that was moral progress, and now you're saying you miss the good old days of people throwing bricks? Seriously: I had the impulse to make a comment about the perversity of your enthusiasm for a denomination that I think is Bleeding out even faster than mine--Presb. Ch. USA--and I thought no, that wouldn't be nice.*
     I guess I'm not done learning how this internet thingy is supposed to go. I hate it when that happens.

*Also not accurate: I now see that the PCUSA lost more members last year. We're number one!
