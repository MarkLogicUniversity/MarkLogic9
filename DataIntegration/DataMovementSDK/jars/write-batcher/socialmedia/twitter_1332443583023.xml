Â 
Do you even read what you post and did Masters even mention â€œGlobal warmingâ€&#157; or global in your post? 
Â 
Did you read the part about he jet steam which indicates the cause?
Â 
&lt;i&gt;The jet stream pattern features a large, southwards dipping bulge over the Western U.S., creating a trough of low pressure with Cold and snow, and a large, northwards looping bulge over the Central U.S., creating a record-strength ridge of high pressure. The Western U.S. trough has cut  into a "cut-Off low" that is slowly drifting eastwards&lt;/i&gt;
Â 
What do you think temps are doing on the other side of that jet stream in Alaska and the NW coast? 
Â 
Did miss this part or your post? Â &lt;i&gt;Remarkable late-season snow storm on West Coast&lt;/i&gt;
Â 
Since the area Masters talks about is roughly 2% of the â€œglobeâ€&#157;,Â  how do you think the other 98% fairs? However that didn't stop far left progressive Joe Romm from making that false claim too. 
Â 
&lt;i&gt;DID THEY LOOK AT ACTUAL GLOBAL DATA which is showing a Colder than normal March globally, a Colder than normal year so far globally, a 3 year retreat in global temps , before making such statements and if so , how do they blame it being warm in one place when its Cold, and getting Colder everywhere else, on the OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE ACTUAL DATA SHOWS.&lt;/i&gt;

If youâ€™re a teacher, I feel sorry for your students because you certainly didnâ€™t do your homework on that comment. </body><verb>delete</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yv6r6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yzh7</id></website><link>http://blogs.kansas.com/weblog/2012/03/kancare-bidders-scrambling-to-sign-up-providers/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T11:34:46+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:52:52+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mic89b</id><link>http://blogs.kansas.com/weblog/2012/03/kancare-bidders-scrambling-to-sign-up-providers/#comment-473795230</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/0uie</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>killed</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
