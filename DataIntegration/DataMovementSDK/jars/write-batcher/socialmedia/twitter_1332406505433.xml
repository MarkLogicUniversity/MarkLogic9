     The garrisons of every empire held court deciding the fates of resistance fighters proclaining each guilty in turn to be issued their sentences of death for having attempted the protection of their commons villages and homes from invaders. Jews sweltered and froze in fetid Warsaw sewage and hunger, Spartans sacrificed their lives against Darious&amp;#039; indomintable reign then only to be now the very visage of victom of the same agressors taunts jibes and blade. As prophets, pundits, jackals jesters and balladeers of every tongue and stripe make dutiful note through ages of conflict, horror and mass killing by ranks of lemmings charging before lord and master shooting archers volleys into human flesh, sinking battle  through skulls while grandeliquent generals, lords and barons assasins dine with wine and song in back rooms murkey smoke regaling themselves of their glory that day in battles for nothing but such braggadocio from hounds and master alike, agression is an addiction and with it comes the ugly side of a wealthy persons senses of need and how to supply them. 
 
    Sages of battle lore long past, Anne of Arrogonne, Mary Queen of Scots, That Greek face which launched a thousand ships to Troy, from Marie Antoinette, Mary Magdeline, Hellenic, Romantic, Atheneic, sublime, slitherous and quite cunning women of war are as agressive as vipers and every bit as decitful as any man of war, this days agressor is all of the above and more with more grandiloquent designs, less tangible proofs and far greater liabilities in their ladings of statecraft with weapons more powerful than the sling of David, catapults of the Celts or arrows of  Elizabethan bemetaled knights, the warmongers most advantageous assult and  are against the human mind, today as ever they have been with a deeper more insidious Reach with weapons more vaunted for their decptions and luring into trance than blodd letting or maiming of the flesh by chance, these arrows are aimed at the hearts of the chosen few deciders of fates of target states who claim they own even heavens gates, forsooth their footmen gather now, the vestiges of their cash cows, run now agresing masters flocks and horde, hide thy spoils behind thy boards and batten down the gates of heaven for thy hellions made in battles far are lurking close with scimitar, blade raised in angry glare you made me thus without a care, look now their bloodshot eyes ablaze with fury made in warrings haze, we mount, we charge we ride against agressors blades with franensence, with myhr and sage our weapons won, our spoils as peons daughter&amp;#039;s sons, are sticks and stones but righteously we meekly seeth to vanquish thee, out love, our shepherds faning gaze leads us not through battles haze against with nothing on our backs, no mighty gun and empty sacks the deaths of dead men dying still charging down Golgotha&amp;#039;s hill agressors see their faces not nor count the ranks to counterplot, the dead and missing of countless wars will fight and settle countless scores and when at length the range is clear one tin soldiers visage clear, the smokes of time will settle then the scores of histories valient men. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:179807:126963925</id><idPostId>126963925</idPostId><idBlogId>179807</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:179807</id><idBlogId>179807</idBlogId><link>http://www.informationclearinghouse.info</link><displayName>Information Clearing House - News you won&amp;#039;t find on CNN</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article30878.htm</link><displayName>&amp;nbsp;John Perkins:&amp;nbsp; Aggression Begets Aggression&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; : Information Clearing House</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T08:53:53.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:179807:126963925:321804778</id><link>http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article30878.htm#IDComment321804778</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T08:53:53.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on &amp;nbsp;John Perkins:&amp;nbsp; Aggression Begets Aggression&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; : Information Clearing House by jerrygates777</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link/><idEmailMd5>bc2656cbb7ef6d7f1b61924747c78f7d</idEmailMd5><displayName>jerrygates777</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>jerrygates777 commented on &lt;a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article30878.htm"&gt;&amp;nbsp;John Perkins:&amp;nbsp; Aggression Begets Aggression&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; : Information Clearing House&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
