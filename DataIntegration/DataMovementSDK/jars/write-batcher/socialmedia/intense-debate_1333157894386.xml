Seems as though they should have some sort of religious meeting in the psychiatric ward she is living in.   But I suspect this more about her defense attorney - trying to get her involved in the "outside" world, so they can build up some credibility when asking for her release in a few years.. They can say "she's been out in the real world and thrives in it
',etc...   Andrea Yates' roommate at one point was a woman named Dena Schlosser, who cut Off her infants arms and legs and let the child Bleed to death..
