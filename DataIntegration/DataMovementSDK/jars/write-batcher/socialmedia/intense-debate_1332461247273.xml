"On his Mar 2 program, Malloy suggested the storms were God's way of getting back at people he thinks don't believe in science.



'Their God … keeps smashing them into little grease Spots on the pavement in  Alabama, and Mississippi, and Arkansas, and Georgia, and Oklahoma,' Malloy said.
'You know, the Bible belt, where [in a fake southern accent] they ain’t gonna let no g*******d science get in the way, it says in the Bible, blah blah blah blah blah,' he said mockingly.


'So, according to their way of thinking, God with his omnipotent thumb Reaches down here and so far tonight has smashed about 20 people into a grease Spot on highway 12, or whatever the hell highway they live next to.'”


The worst kind of hypocrites, who hide their effort to silence a political opponent under the sanctimonious guise of "concerns" about "racism" and "civil discourse."</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yu3ta</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ju4p</id></website><link>http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/03/22/the-city-of-la-joins-attacks-on-free-speech-talk-radio</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:48:52+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T22:32:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mim3o3</id><link>http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/03/22/the-city-of-la-joins-attacks-on-free-speech-talk-radio#comment-474022113</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hobvx</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
