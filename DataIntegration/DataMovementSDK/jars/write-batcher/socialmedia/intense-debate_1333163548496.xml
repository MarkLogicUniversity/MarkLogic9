There was no bloody nose, no marks on his head and I saw it just like the rest of America saw the same dam thing. I cannot believe that people are still lying for this man. My question is how did he get a gun if has a Felony? Oh I forgot the case was closed because of the strong ties he has with the judical system with mommy and daddy. The young kid is dead and he has to answer to that PERIOD. I wonder if Zimmerman had a 17yr old and someone killed his son would it be the same thing. HELL NO.I am going to pray for Trayvons family becasue like I said before the system is not made for black people. Everyone want to deny that it's a race issue when it is. This man killed a child I dont care how big or small this kid was, Zimmerman wanted to Act and be a super hero and killed a child in Cold blood there is nothing him or his family can say to justify that. The only way this kids family is going to get a fair trial is if they move the case completely out of Florida!!! </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z3b9t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:25:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:54:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwdztk</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-480762211</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zlve6</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
