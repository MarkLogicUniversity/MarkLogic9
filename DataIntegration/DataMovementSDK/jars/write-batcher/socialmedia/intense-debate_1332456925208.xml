I enjoyed the books as well, but felt the writing was rather clunky in Spots; this is one where I think the film may well surpass the book. My girlfriend doesn't want to see it at all, unfortunately, so I'll probably wind up having to wait for the DVD/Bluray release. Glad to hear so much positive buzz about it, all the same.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yfc18</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/m1wv</id></website><link>http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2012/03/22/review-the-hunger-games/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T18:46:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T21:05:31+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miet2l</id><link>http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2012/03/22/review-the-hunger-games/#comment-473953692</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
