If WWE is going to announce next years main event than the players will need to be under contract. Hopefully it's SCSA/Punk because fans want that more. No matter what the announcement is next years WM could be chalked full of main event matches and WWE will have to decide which one goes on last. I am leaning towards Taker retiring like you said with the "end of an Era" talk. I just think that Cena/Rock will rematch sometime this year and Cena will Â move on to face Brock. Shit I don't know the more I think about it I get a Headache.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67hv14</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zf9l</id></website><link>http://www.sescoops.com/wrestling-news/wwe/lesnar-negotiating-with-wwe-to-appear-at-wrestlemania-28/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:39:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T22:54:00+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwq9oq</id><link>http://www.sescoops.com/wrestling-news/wwe/lesnar-negotiating-with-wwe-to-appear-at-wrestlemania-28/#comment-481291363</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gc4jl</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
