I've seen people stand on the North Jetty at Ocean shores and let the Cold vaves wash over them in mid winter. then in the old days I saw people strip naked to go after those littte grunions in the . Or fish for Crabs at the old Russian ship bearied in the sand at copalils. Or dig 60 clams instead of 15 and on all Tides of the year, day or night. Or have the store at copalis freeze your clams free as long as you stayed in their cabins. cabins were $5.00 to $10.00 per day including use of a clam shovel. Some one be sure I spelled the words right. OK PS. The clams were never sick until 1979 how about that?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vf1qh</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnms</id></website><link>http://www.theolympian.com/2012/04/01/2053355/5-ways-to-enjoy-the-washington.html</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T19:51:03+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T06:29:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0j5au</id><link>http://www.theolympian.com/2012/04/01/2053355/5-ways-to-enjoy-the-washington.html#comment-483314747</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6d581</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
