You guys, I was starting to move on a little. I went a whole comment (sort of) without mentioning Doyle and then &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;. Why?????????????? 
 
I&amp;#039;ll flap right along with you, Angel. I miss him. A lot. I still have a Doyle-shaped hole in my heart, although Wesley has managed to make it stop Bleeding. But why would you do this to me? Once again, I was convinced we&amp;#039;d see Doyle, standing in the binding circle. I know that makes no sense, only voices were borrowed, but that&amp;#039;s what I thought would happen. 
 
Gotta shake this ...okay, other things happened in this episode besides missing Doyle. What? Oh yeah, kid being possessed by a demon who couldn&amp;#039;t escape the kid. But, fun fact, Lizzie Borden was acquitted. 
 
I love Wesley. If Joss kills him or ruins his life to a ridiculous degree, I will never forgive Whedon. (It&amp;#039;s Always Whedon&amp;#039;s fault.) And the friendships on this show are beautiful. 
 
And Angel was positively monochromatic in this episode. Black is so classic. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:226781:127356009</id><idPostId>127356009</idPostId><idBlogId>226781</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:226781</id><idBlogId>226781</idBlogId><link>http://markwatches.net/reviews</link><displayName>Mark Watches</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://markwatches.net/reviews/2012/03/mark-watches-angel-s01e14-ive-got-you-under-my-skin/</link><displayName>Mark Watches 'Angel': S01E14 - I've Got You Under My Skin</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:17:26.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:226781:127356009:328031277</id><link>http://markwatches.net/reviews/2012/03/mark-watches-angel-s01e14-ive-got-you-under-my-skin/#IDComment328031277</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:17:26.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Mark Watches 'Angel': S01E14 - I've Got You Under My Skin by stellaaaaakris</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://intensedebate.com/people/stellaaaaakris</link><idEmailMd5>b92f169ddfc4901ab104f5b435886023</idEmailMd5><displayName>stellaaaaakris</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/people/stellaaaaakris"&gt;stellaaaaakris&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://markwatches.net/reviews/2012/03/mark-watches-angel-s01e14-ive-got-you-under-my-skin/"&gt;Mark Watches 'Angel': S01E14 - I've Got You Under My Skin&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
