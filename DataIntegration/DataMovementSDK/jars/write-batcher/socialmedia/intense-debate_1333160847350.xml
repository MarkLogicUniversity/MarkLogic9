They refuse to take a job that's less than $100K and would rather sit home and get free money and live the good life  welfare then actually working a hard for a living. It all stems back to their Bleeding heart liberal leader Obama, his idea of hard work is blaming all our problems on the rich, smoking cigarettes and playing basketball. Under Bush who's hardworking nature rubbed Off on people and the country and no coincidence the economy was booming. We desperately need a Republican in office who will bring the right attitude and work ethic to office, Liberalism is the cancer that is destroying this once great country.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z0k86</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rvx5</id></website><link>http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/30/news/economy/housing-jobs-unemployed/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T09:26:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:36:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mweszy</id><link>http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/30/news/economy/housing-jobs-unemployed/#comment-480692097</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/aaf1w</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
