Oh, at that time George had pork-chop side Burns.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z1vqj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnde</id></website><link>http://www.sunherald.com/2012/03/29/3851173/george-jones-hospitalized-in-nashville.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:42:51+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:57:14+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwh9wb</id><link>http://www.sunherald.com/2012/03/29/3851173/george-jones-hospitalized-in-nashville.html#comment-481011646</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h8saj</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
