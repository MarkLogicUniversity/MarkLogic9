This resulted in a huge loss of sleep and major Anxiety, so I weened  it for a few days. No bueno.

Something tells me that Cold turkey is the way to go.Â I'm attempting this right now and have been Off cigs for almost three months. I've had a few relapses (count: 3) that all involved Â being very drunk, but nobody's perfect.Â 

I'm looking forward to your e-cig piece! I don't know if that's the solution, but it's definitely better than getting tar in your lungs, right? Good luck!
