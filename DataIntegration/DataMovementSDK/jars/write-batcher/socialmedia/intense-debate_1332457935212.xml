Turris came in and was on fire but he has tailed Off considerably. It isn't just him though, the entire 2nd line has been looking for consistency for many weeks.

No biggie, this team isn't close to complete and there are going to be ups and downs...we just have to hope they get some scoring from a few guys that have gone Cold (Foligno, Smith, Turris, Alfie, Gonchar...)
