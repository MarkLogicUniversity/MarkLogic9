They don't need electricity, water or anything, just ask my son-in-law. He had
two, that were sussposed to be legals who rented and then he told them they had to move by a certain date, well when it was checked out about two months later, the two had grown to 14 and no electricity,water, but the sewage worked but with no water, well you get the picture, he almost had to tear down the house. Those illegals from our neighbor to the south, you know who I mean are, filthy, ignorent and plain mean.
And that's the plain truth, man what a mess, he threw their furnature in the street, had to haul Off 14 commerical size trash bags full of "stuff", the refregerator had rotten food in it and he just threw it out. The carpet was full of candel wax and Burns, that had to be ripped out, it was a real mess</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rvkvn</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/o2bq</id></website><link>http://patriotupdate.com/20307/activist-group-teaches-homeless-how-to-invade-apartments</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T19:47:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-27T13:23:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/msdd1g</id><link>http://patriotupdate.com/20307/activist-group-teaches-homeless-how-to-invade-apartments#comment-477395429</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
