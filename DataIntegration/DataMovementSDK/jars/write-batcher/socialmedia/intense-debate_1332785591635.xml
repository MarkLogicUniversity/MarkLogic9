I read another review that hammered the film for being too violent. Clearly, the violence upset that reviewer but not this one. Â Whether or not the violence upsets is more a function of the viewer's preferences, not the filmmaker's.Â 

This reviewer clearly sets forth individual opinion with the statement:
"If you're in the market for a terrific film that revolves around teenagers murdering one another...". Â So, this reviewer seems to come from the standpont that watching teenagers murdering each other is pretty sweet. Â But, it's an opinion.

I will probably see the film. Likely, I will consider it to be very violent, because I have little tolerance for viewing violence. Thus, I may consider the filmmaker to have captured the violence of the book well enough without becoming a gory slaughterfest that might make me Vomit and have nightmares for a couple of weeks; but, that's my preference. Many other folks will think differently.Â 

So, just read smartly. Understand where the author of this review is coming from, make your own decision, and Act accordingly.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6euqtu</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ydw9</id></website><link>http://motherjones.com/node/168156</link><postedTime>2012-03-18T23:57:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-24T21:08:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk89il</id><link>http://motherjones.com/node/168156#comment-475459428</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zebrx</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-18</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
