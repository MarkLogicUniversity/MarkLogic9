I intended the Bleeding heart bit to be generic, not
personal.Â  But that is my point.Â  If a tenant is pissed at the landlord all
they have to do is call the city and pull the trigger.Â  The city comes out and creates a Headache
threatening to fine the landlord something on the order of $125/day if an issue
which, in my case, was caused by the tenant, is not remedied. ( there were 5
people showering and cooking in a 650 sqft apt which they chose not to Heat, a-holes
complained of mold on their wall that they were functionally cultivating) Â A tenant sells dope, it is the landlord they
come down on.Â  Yet a landlord is not
allowed to discriminate against a person with a dope arrest.Â  City Hall has run amok pandering to sob story
anecdotes rather than making â€œdata based decisionsâ€&#157; like they suddenly think
the police should do.Â  The big mold scare
of late is typical freak out du jour.
