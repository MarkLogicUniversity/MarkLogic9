For those of you who do not know a stent is a sort of plastic tube that runs fromÂ kidney through ureter and into bladder. I was in constant pain- or if not, constant Burning discomfort. BUT I was still much better Off (millions of times better) then most of the people commenting here. But even those eight weeks brought on depression, fights with my partner, and a feeling of overwhelming weight. After crying for two days straight and having no sleep I was finally prescribed morphine and percocets. I felt guilty for straight out asking for pain killers. I felt like a junkie! I was embarrassed for properly taking prescribed medications. That's not how it should be. Now I'm back to work, obviously I'm not continuing with meds as they're not needed. But because they were prescribed to me I could get the rest I needed to heal my body stress free. Thank you doctors who understand!Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/65qnx3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/r11g</id></website><link>http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/03/15/the-latest-opium-war/</link><postedTime>2012-03-15T17:50:33+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-18T02:45:39+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m9fn8o</id><link>http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/03/15/the-latest-opium-war/#comment-468125668</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-15</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
