Leaving aside this government's incompetent meddling, the "fuel crisis" as you call it, is simply an industrial dispute between the drivers of petrol tankers, and the several companies who jointly employ them. So far, so simple. In a free country (of which, more later, no doubt) a worker may withdraw his labour: peopleÂ are not slaves. Furthermore, any employer is equally free toÂ universally alter the contracts of employmentÂ between himself and his employees. As, for example, the slash and Burn economics of Local Councils, the Government's attack on the public sector, and any other employer who thinks it opportune to exploit the current economic slump by a reduction of its workforce's benefits (pensions and salaries particularly).Â  That's called free-market Capitalism, ain't it?

I think the real questionÂ you're fumbling for is: "Is Ed Milliband for or againstÂ a fuelÂ strike"? That would be more accurate, don't you think?

And, of course, the answer to that question, as you well know,Â is a resounding NO, he isn't if favour of a fuel strike. Time and again he has publicly stated that he wishes to see this dispute  through mediation and arbitration (asÂ nearly all strikesÂ  are ultimately so Resolved). But then again.... the breath of sanity doesn't fit well with the Telegraph'sÂ political agenda, does it.

Neither the Telegraph's nor the Tory Party's hysterics willÂ goad anyÂ Labour supporter, high or low, to agreeÂ with the preposterous proposition that strikes should be made illegal. That is the fantasy world inhabited by Neocons,Â uber-right motoring correspondents called Jeremy, communists regimes and fascist dictatorships.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hodoq</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9171485/Is-Ed-Miliband-for-or-against-a-fuel-crisis.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T19:37:17+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T15:22:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw3cnr</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9171485/Is-Ed-Miliband-for-or-against-a-fuel-crisis.html#comment-481914443</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/64ud4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
