I can't believe there are people who actually fell for this. You must be new or not know much about Yunho's activities if you fall for this BS. The "failed musical and bashed MJ concert" and the worry about him falling on Kiss and Cry should be enough to tell you that this person is trolling.Â 
Since the lawsuit we had these JYJ stans talking everywhere like Yunho is completely worthless while their oppas are so much more talented (evern Yoochun, lol). They are so easy to Spot for anyone who knows a thing or two about this fandom.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/e6knc1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mo0x</id></website><link>http://kpopsecrets.tumblr.com/post/8684545478</link><postedTime>2011-08-09T09:32:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-08-09T15:33:55+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/5utexe</id><link>http://kpopsecrets.tumblr.com/post/8684545478#comment-281297562</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-08-09</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
