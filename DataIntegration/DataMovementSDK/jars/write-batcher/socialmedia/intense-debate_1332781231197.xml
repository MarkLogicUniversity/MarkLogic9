Plus, we the Taxpayers get to pick up a $7,500 "rebate" to convince people to buy one of these things. For what? Global warming? Look out your window...from anywhere on Earth. Its getting Colder. Shortage of oil??? There will only be a shortage because the America-hating imbecile in the White House has pressed for a nationwide drilling Ban....everywhere, not just deep water drilling. So what is this really all about? Carbon? Hardly!! Carbon is an integrel part of life itself. The air is cleansed everytime it rains or snows. Carbon goes back to the earth and is recycled again.No, this is about power and control. Its about bringing the richest, most free and powerful nation in the written history of man to its destruction, in order to bring about a worldwide reorganization of power. So this car is bull, the reason it was built is bull, and those that buy it are full of bull and those that are paying for it are getting drilled in the @#$. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/cr7zy3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/chevy-volt/2010/12/31/chevy-volt-sales-microscopic</link><postedTime>2010-12-31T17:16:00+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2010-12-31T19:22:16+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/82bo28</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/chevy-volt/2010/12/31/chevy-volt-sales-microscopic#comment-121995074</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/anjah</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2010-12-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
