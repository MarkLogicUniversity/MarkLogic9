Mormons have no career clergy, and they each have had secular careers outside Church leadership, whether in business.or academia, engineering, medicine, law, or the military. They respect the expertise of their individual members, and draw on that expertise.  They do not think that just because they are religioys leaders that they are smart enough to be experts on science or politics.  They are far more modest about the  if their callings than many of the professiinal ministers in other denominations. In fact, in order to avoid the tendency of some members to  try to psyche out Church leaders' political views, the Church has asked full time leaders to avoid even donating to candidates. 

The primary political policy teaching of Joseph Smith was "I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves". Mormons are encouraged to think for themselvrs on many issues, and not even accept religious teachings without study and prayer.  The Church leadership would prefer more balance in Mormon participation in the national political parties, so that one does not take them for granted while the other writes them Off and doesn't care about their votes.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hcpj2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ant8</id></website><link>http://www.alternet.org/story/154710/former_mormon_what_americans_need_to_know_about_mormonism/comments/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T04:55:04+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:29:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3tcqj</id><link>http://www.alternet.org/story/154710/former_mormon_what_americans_need_to_know_about_mormonism/comments/#comment-479488311</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gkjgb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
