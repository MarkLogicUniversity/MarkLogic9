I was twenty yearsÂ in the U.S. Coast Guard and was personally involved in many search and rescue operations in the churning ocean as you call it.Â  We would go to sea when others were returning to port and sail into storms that others ran from, all to save lives.Â  SoÂ I qualify for going into the churning ocean, once literally.Â  I have spent time above the Arctic Circle and and operatingÂ in the Barents andÂ Bering Seas so I am very familiar with Cold weather operations.

I do indeed criticize anyone would let another human die to mark something Off their life-time to do list.Â  

The man was saved; it could obviously be done.Â  Those that did not even attempt to help him I have no use for.Â  They are somethingÂ less than fully human.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6850xl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/791w</id></website><link>http://www.rd.com/true-stories/survival/hiker-left-for-dead-on-mount-everest/</link><postedTime>2012-03-12T14:55:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-18T00:06:46+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m91e0f</id><link>http://www.rd.com/true-stories/survival/hiker-left-for-dead-on-mount-everest/#comment-468062053</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-12</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
