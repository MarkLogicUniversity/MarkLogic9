It was a case of mistaken identity that started it: the man called her Francine three times as she  down the path and eventually she stopped and turned, even though her name was not Francine. He caught up with her,  a little from his exertion.
â€œI knew Iâ€™d see you here today, Francine.â€&#157;
â€œMy nameâ€™s not Francine, youâ€™re mistaken.â€&#157;
He didnâ€™t appear to be mad or bad and wasnâ€™t carrying  or gun, just a bag.
â€œOK â€“ not Francine, so what name are you using today?â€&#157;
â€œWhat... do I know you?â€&#157;
â€œNo of course you donâ€™t. You donâ€™t know any of us but we know all about you Franc.... sorry not Francine, what name are you using?â€&#157;
â€œIâ€™m using my own name â€“ thank you â€“ and Iâ€™d thank you to buzz  and leave me alone.â€&#157;
â€œYes, yes Iâ€™m going but Iâ€™ll let everyone Iâ€™ve seen you and hereâ€™s your money.â€&#157;
He held out the bag he was carrying opening it to show her neatly bundled packs of dollar bills inside.
â€œWhat money... what are you doing?â€&#157;
â€œItâ€™s the $20,000 you wanted. Take it and I can go. Iâ€™ve done my job.â€&#157;
What caught her eye was the photo on top of the money. There was no mistaking the identity of the person in it: it was her. More worryingly it showed her standing on the very same Spot in Central Park that she was standing on right now and she was wearing the same clothes and holding that same bag.
Â 
The stranger thrust the bag into her hands then turned and quickly Strode away leaving her bemused and not a little worried.
Inside the bag was a second photo. It was of an empty NYPD car and it was parked right outside her apartment and there was no disputing who the woman was standing next to the car. She was looking straight into the camera and was carrying that same bag and wearing the same clothes.
Â 
Who was that man? What was this money for, what was going on? Was she going crazy?
Â 
She left Central Park clutching the bag close to her and hailed a cab. Giving her address to the driver she got in and sat back in the seat, thoughts racing through her mind.
She noticed an old, black ballet shoe on the seat.
â€œDriver someoneâ€™s left this shoe behind.â€&#157;
The driver smiled at her in his rear view mirror.
â€œThe ballet shoeâ€™s for you Francine. Youâ€™re going to need it as well as the $20,000 so take it with you when you get to your apartment.â€&#157;
A silent scream was welling inside her. She was trapped in this cab with its centrally locked doors and felt powerless and speechless.

The cab pulled to a halt at her apartment behind a blue and white NYPD car. She got out of that cab fast â€“ no fee charged and looked inside the car. It was empty but she noticed a photo on the dashboard. It was an exact copy of the one showing her holding the bag in Central Park. 
Turning she found herself looking into a camera held by a youth a few yards away who snapped a shot of her standing by the Car
The resulting photo must have been identical to that of the second photo in her bag.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6v48xp</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ms5w</id></website><link>http://my.telegraph.co.uk/theshortstoryclub/?p=211</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T13:16:12+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T08:46:41+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0j3m4</id><link>http://my.telegraph.co.uk/theshortstoryclub/?p=211#comment-483352542</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hbf3m</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
