in 2012 because the required number of signatures could not be mustered.
 I believe this happened because most Mainerâ€™s have come to realize that
 this would not have been a â€œclean energyâ€&#157; bill at all. Maybe it should 
have been called the â€œWind Industry Initiative â€œbill or the â€œClean 
Energy Hoaxâ€&#157; bill. However that may be, it is clear that the â€œclean 
energy billâ€&#157; is a complete and misleading misnomer.
Industrial 
wind turbines DO NOT provide clean energy. CO2 is being sequestered all 
the time. It happens wherever water, CO2 and sunshine work in vegetation
 through a process called photosynthesis. This process produces the 
Oxygen we and all other animals need to breathe and live. An industrial 
wind turbine cannot do this. When wind industry front agents say this 
they say they mean that wind turbines do not produce CO2 and the energy 
they produce offsets the CO2 that would be produced by fossil fueled 
electricity generation. They CANÂ NOT sequester 1 molecule of CO2 and 
produce Oxygen as could as the acres of trees clear cut to make space 
for an industrial wind turbine.
Industrial wind turbines DO NOT 
provide clean energy. The workings of a turbine is a matter of using the
 wind to move propeller like blades which turns the shaft of a generator
 to produce electricity. The only problem is that this process if 
grossly inefficient. So, engineers worked to develop and more efficient 
generator. Â This meant reducing the friction in the system and using 
very powerful magnets to set up a magnetic field in the stator (stable, 
non-rotating) field through which the rotor (rotating coil of wire) 
could move cutting the lines of force of the stator to create electric 
current.
Researchers discovered that they could make alloys of 
metals that had incredible magnetic properties. Permanent magnet stators
 made using alloys containing the rare Earth called Yttrium provided 
about the most highly effective generators. These magnets are so strong 
that discs of the alloys brought together to repel each other required 
much force and when mounted on a rotor in a generator provided a nearly 
frictionless system for turning a rotor in a stator. But, how do we come
 by the much prized rare earth element?
This material is not 
actually rare. It was only called that because of the historical 
circumstances that occurred as it was discovered and located in the 
periodic table of the elements. In fact, China is currently the largest 
supplier of the material and almost all countries are exploring its 
mining. The problem is that strip mining for this ore is difficult and 
the pits it is mined from become contaminated with highly toxic 
materials. Strip mining this needed special ore that leaves a lake of 
poisonous chemicals, requires the use of large amounts of diesel fuel 
which, as it is Burned, releases large quantities of CO2 into the 
atmosphere.
Now the needed ores must be processed and refined to 
be used in the manufacture of an industrial wind turbine. These 
processes all require Burning fossil fuels and Burning large amounts of 
fossil fuels are Burned all through the manufacture of these machines. 
This releases more CO2 into the atmosphere. Once manufactured, the 
turbines must be loaded onto ocean vessels and be transported by ocean 
to wherever they are intended to be installed.Â  These vessels are 
powered by many tons of fossil fuels and release megatons of CO2 into 
the atmosphere.
Once they arrive at their destination, the 
turbines must be offloaded to heavy duty vehicles which must transport 
them to their installation site. More diesel fuels pump more CO2 into 
the atmosphere. These vehicles require very special roads for the 
delivery operation. The roads must be wide enough to make the turns. The
 roads must be deeply packed and packed hard. They wonâ€™t just ride along
 on a logging road. Diesel powered equipment must be used to prepare the
 installment roads and final site and that means creating wide 
hard-packed barriers to small wildlife, compartmentalizing  species 
which need to meet. This is just one of the Hellacious assaults on 
wildlife habitats performed by industrial wind turbines.
Next they
 must be installed. This is no little feat. The columns to hold the 
turbine can be 400 to 500 feet tall or more. The casing and the turbine 
is many tons and each fiberglass blade on the windmill may weigh over 7 
tons. And the machines huff out even more CO2. So much fossil fuel must 
be Burned in this process that, before they ever start turning, each 
industrial wind turbine is responsible for releasing megatons of CO2 
into the atmosphere. Once tested and fully installed the turbine needs 
close maintenance including lubrication with lots and lots of, you know 
what, oil! And if they donâ€™t have the required lubrication they can, 
will, and have burst into flame and throw Burning materials out into the
 forests around. Fire fighters are powerless to put them out and must 
tend to fires that Reach the ground. Of course this if difficult if they
 are sited on remote forested mountaintops and ridges in the wilderness 
of Maine. Just what is a remote fire warden to do?
Industrial wind
 turbines provide anything but clean energy and the only renewable part 
of Industrial wind turbine electricity is the expensive tax and 
electricity rates needed to artificially prop-up (subsidize) the 
wind-power industry.Â
