There's a hiking trail called Rock City. The trail leads you up and along the bluffs looking over thousands of acres of beautiful farm land. The trails follows the fringe of the bluff and through endangered hill prairies until it leads you to the end of one of its trails where there's a scenic view. Essentially, it's a cliff that hangs a good hundred feet  the ground and the view is spectacular. Seeing the sun slowly set behind the Mississippi River is something that not too many people get to see. Not to many people visit the trail, so it's very enjoyable to seek solitude out in the country. I wouldn't have it any other way! All in all, it's my Slice of heaven. Beauty is everywhere, you just have to find the best Spots to observe it all.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lfi6r</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/r3ku</id></website><link>http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2012/03/yonder_mountain_string_band_tickets_win.php</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T16:15:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:26:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3k7lf</id><link>http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2012/03/yonder_mountain_string_band_tickets_win.php#comment-480156793</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zz1ka</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
