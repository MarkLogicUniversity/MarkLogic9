I am Glad those 2 at least are now grown men with families I am sure.  I also got payback for this gesture as I was taking cover I got a tap on the shoulder and it was now 3 of your guys giving up to me and my oppo.  They saw how we treated those prisoners and then realized we were not butchers.  I can say no more except I like the Argentine people as I do all people generally...BUT...you are so deluded...just reread your assertions that Briton was behind your political murder gangs.  It was the British win down south that allowed some sort of democracy to replace your dictator ships.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lmzur</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mf6v</id></website><link>http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/03/27/the-falklands-a-view-from-argentina/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T22:09:06+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:58:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m34t4y</id><link>http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/03/27/the-falklands-a-view-from-argentina/#comment-479553057</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cnuxo</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
