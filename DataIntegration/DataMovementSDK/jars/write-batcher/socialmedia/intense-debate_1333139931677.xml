when baking cakes, your rule of thumb is Always do a touch test: bake for 15 min at 180 (i never bake at 170 because as you open the oven, your temp drops and it delays your innitial baking time), open the oven and check every 5-10 min after that. if the cake is springy to the touch, its done, even if the inside of the cake is still a bit gooey, reason being, the rest of the baking process will continue outside of the oven due to internal Heat.
as stated before, because of concerns like temperature and altitude, baking times are never exact and need to be played with. hope this helps!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/5brxgz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/vd0s</id></website><link>http://www.redbrickpaper.co.uk/2011/04/hummingbird-bakery-carrot-cake/</link><postedTime>2011-04-14T15:28:48+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T08:32:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwce0i</id><link>http://www.redbrickpaper.co.uk/2011/04/hummingbird-bakery-carrot-cake/#comment-480519210</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzii6</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-04-14</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
