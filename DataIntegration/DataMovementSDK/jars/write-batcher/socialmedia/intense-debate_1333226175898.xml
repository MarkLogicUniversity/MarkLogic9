I must Always laugh when the reliability of turbodiesel engines is mentioned since these diesels have rather many notorious problems related to their complicated design (problems with injection ports, turbos etc.), high sensitivity to quality of the diesel you have in your tank, problems to run in extremely Cold weather etc. resulting in much more expensive maintanance. If you don't experience the same problems in Canada, you must have different diesel engines in your cars than we have in Europe (beware sarcasm).</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67cvfc</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ni5e</id></website><link>http://www.auto123.com/en/kia/optima-hybrid/2011/review?carid=1113002006&amp;artid=142050</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:46:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T21:46:34+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw4nue</id><link>http://www.auto123.com/en/kia/optima-hybrid/2011/review?carid=1113002006&amp;artid=142050#comment-481236738</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
