holy text." Arthur Armstrong

Well stated Mr. Armstrong. It's easy to be good without God or gods.... millions of people do so every day. The need for some to adhere to religious and or political authoritarianism... against all rhyme, reason, truth and facts... and against their own economic and social best interests...is fascinating to observe....

"The doctrine of eternal 
punishment is in perfect harmony with the savagery of the men who made the 
orthodox creeds. It is in harmony with torture, with flaying alive, and with 
burnings. The men who Burned their fellow-men for a moment, believed that God 
would Burn his enemies forever."Â Â  Robert

"The doctrine that future happiness Depends upon 
belief is monstrous. It is the infamy of infamies. The notion that faith in 
Christ is to be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon 
reason, observation and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for 
refutation, and can be relieved only by that unhappy mixture of insanity and 
ignorance, called "faith." What man, who ever thinks, can believe that blood can 
appease God? And yet, our entire system of religion is based upon that belief. 
The Jews pacified Jehovah with the blood of animals, and according to the 
Christian system, the blood of Jesus softened the heart of God a little, and 
rendered possible the salvation of a fortunate few. It is hard to conceive how 
the human mind can give assent to such terrible ideas, or how any sane man can 
read the Bible and still believe in the doctrine of inspiration." Â  Robert Green Ingersoll

Is he 
both able and willing?
