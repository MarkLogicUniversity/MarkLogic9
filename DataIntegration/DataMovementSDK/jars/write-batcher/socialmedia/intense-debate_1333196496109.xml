1. You don't want to consume all your data? Don't turn on LTE. Don't watch movies except with wifi. etc.

2. Heat? Hasn't happened. Maybe if you run games for an hour straight. But that's no reason to NOT get the new  if you can justify its usage.

3. Poor wifi? Hasn't happened to me, including at a place that had iffy wifi before. It's better and faster than ever.

4. Smart cover issues? What is he talking about? (I have a smart cover. love it. No problems.)

5. Today was my first day using it as normal. LESS  drain than ever. I charge it overnight.  have, Always will. What's the problem?

6. Yellow tint? Haven't seen it. If it's there, doesn't bother me.
