the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led 
their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods.  In 
such cases, you must examine the facts carefully.  If you find it is true and 
can prove that such a detestable Act has occurred among you, you must attack 
that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the 
livestock.  Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and 
Burn it.  Put the entire town to the torch as a Burnt offering to the LORD 
your God.  That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.  
Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction.  Then the LORD 
will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you.  He will have compassion 
on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your 
ancestors.  "The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep 
all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him."  
(Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)
