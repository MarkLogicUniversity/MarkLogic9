Losing the flag ship / capital ship is a psychological shock that many Navies never come back from.
Hence,Â Trafalgar, or the HSF Paralysis after Jutland, IJN post-Midway, or losing Repulse and Prince of Wales.

In each of these cases, the psychological shock was just as important as the immediate victory. Â 

If UK lost one of its carriers during the Falklands, the campaign would have ground to a halt --- and the invasion called Off.

In ancient times, it is as if the King was killed at the battlefield --- the army just melts away even though their fighting ability was hardly changed shortly before or after the King was killed.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ml7mn</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9153258/Britain-has-to-decide-upon-the-Royal-Navys-role.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-19T20:46:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:37:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi5phg</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9153258/Britain-has-to-decide-upon-the-Royal-Navys-role.html#comment-473876393</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hnpm1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-19</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
