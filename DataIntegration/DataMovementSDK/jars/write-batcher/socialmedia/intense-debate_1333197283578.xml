"It's outrageous," Ablow said. "It's beneath the office ... there are tragedies â€” believe me, I'm a forensic psychiatrist â€” there are enough tragedies to go around that if the president wanted to comment on all of them, that would be his whole job. It's irresistible for this president to enter the fray when there seems to be the opportunity for a kind of furious splitting."

Dobbs also scoffed at the White House for saying that the comment had nothing to do with race.

&lt;b&gt;"If the President had a son, he wouldn't look anything like Trayvon Martin," Ablow said. "He'd be wearing a blazer from his prep school, he'd be driving a Beemer and he'd be surrounded by Secret Service. So the president saying 'I can only feel for this kid because he looks physically like me' is absurd ... what about the united view that everybody appreciates what it is to lose a son of any color?"&lt;/b&gt;

"It's peculiar," Dobbs said. Ablow went on to say of Obama, "he's got it in for this country.
