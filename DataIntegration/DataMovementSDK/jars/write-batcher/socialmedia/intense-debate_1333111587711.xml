1. Every decade since the 1960s has been warmer than the  previous one.

2. All 20 of the top 20 hottest years on record occurred since 1981.

3. 9 of the top 10 hottest years on record occurred in the last decade.

4.  All global climate monitoring data sets show warming in the last 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 years.

5.  Oceans are now about 30% more acidic than they were at the start of the industrial revolution.

6. Global glacial mass is at it's lowest record level ever.

7. Arctic ice Reached a record low last September.

8.  There is an unprecedented and sudden rise in record breaking weather events.

9. The stratosphere is cooling- exactly as one would expect in line with CO2 warming the climate- less Heat is escaping into space.

10. Global sea level rose about 17 
centimetres in the last century. That rate is increasing. Fast.  The rate in the last decade, 
however, is nearly double that of the last century.All easily verifiable.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hthio</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ms5i</id></website><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100147742/queensland-turns-the-tide-of-environmental-lunacy/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T16:15:26+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:41:02+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3p9vv</id><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100147742/queensland-turns-the-tide-of-environmental-lunacy/#comment-480077872</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gy7lo</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
