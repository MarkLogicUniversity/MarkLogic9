when i was 12, i saw a documentary on a little boy who thre gas on some old tires. that was almost 40 years ago. i can, if i try, still hear that boys screams as they SCRUBBED the charred fleash from his body while he laid in a bath of saline. maybe they dont teach you such things in the UK, i readily doubt it.Â you folks seem pretty smart.Â i don't believe that child ever blamed the government for his terror!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z3wyz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/fuel/9175292/Fuel-strike-petrol-delivery-backlog-reaches-two-to-three-days-warns-motor-trade-union.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:39:52+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:29:26+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwh54m</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/fuel/9175292/Fuel-strike-petrol-delivery-backlog-reaches-two-to-three-days-warns-motor-trade-union.html#comment-480982543</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/m9clt</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
