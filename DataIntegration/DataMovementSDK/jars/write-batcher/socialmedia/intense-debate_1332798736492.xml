You assume that people have insurance. The ER is used primarily by people without insurance and without money for a doctor. And they already do charge ridiculously high fees. I took my grandson to the ER when he Sliced his finger on a vegetable slicer and we I couldn't get the Bleeding under control. They put a band aid on his finger. I must allow that is was a special band aid that actually fit the finger, but that didn't explain the bill for $1328 plus another $210 for the doctor. This was a Saturday night. Waiting until Monday morning and making an appointment for 2 weeks from then wasn't an option. 

The system needs fixing!
