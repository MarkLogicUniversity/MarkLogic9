thing to do is to turn  the light. However for some people this is 
not as easy as it should be, people sometimes forget and lights are left
 Burning for hours. Motion sensors can help remedy this, by attaching 
the light to a motion sensor you can Ensure the light only comes on 
while there is movement in the room. This is a great way to control your
 home lighting in rooms where you are moving around a lot or in the room
 for a short time. Kitchens and bathrooms could be good candidates for 
this.
