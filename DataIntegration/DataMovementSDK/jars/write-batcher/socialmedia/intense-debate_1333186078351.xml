Drabek has the edge in ERA, 3.18 vs. 4.80, and opponent batting average of .255 vs. .300, but Laffey has the edge in control with 10 strikeouts and ZERO walks against Drabek at 12 strikeouts and SIX walks, giving Laffey a WHIP of 1.20 vs. Drabek at 1.33. Â Both have sufficient innings for Farrell and Walton to have formed an opinion of their own.

Today's start by Laffey may help to sort it out, but I would giveÂ Laffey the edge for nowÂ because of better control and more experience at the major league level.
