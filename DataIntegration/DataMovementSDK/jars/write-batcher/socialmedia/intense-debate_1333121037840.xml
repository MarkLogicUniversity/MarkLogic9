Any blood on his clothing or skin would not have been cleaned away. measures are taken by all responding parties to protect themselves form blood born pathogens.Â In addtion Zimmerman would have been offered the option to go to the hospital and would have had to sign a release declining addtional care. I have worked several fights involving broken noses and or head wounds yes they do Bleed alot due to to plurality of blood vessles in the scalp and the nose. Surprisingly unless he was allowed to change shirts, the front of his shirt should showÂ some signs of blood due to the broken nose. As wellÂ I have never released a patient with a broken nose before transport to the hospital on the basis of possible additional head trama that could have resulted , that is a serious liability issue. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zaa3b</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/28/police-video-trayvon-martins-killer-smoking-gun-lawyer-says/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T03:38:16+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:29:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3965p</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/28/police-video-trayvon-martins-killer-smoking-gun-lawyer-says/#comment-479916749</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6eht0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
