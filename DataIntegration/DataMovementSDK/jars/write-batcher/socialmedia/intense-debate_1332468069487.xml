First years in US every member of my family and our friends
were attacked, robbed, injured, and two even killed during robbery BY BLACK
YOUNG MALES. Russian immigrants didn’t have a clue about black people because
we never had them in Russia,
but now, if I see black youngster in the hood, I have Stomach ache and Headache
from tension. And they enjoying this fear they are triggering. It is not
racism it is the instinct of self-preservation. I believe that this
Zimmerman guy already had this experience and Acted according to it. He would
never be alerted by Asian person –Asians don’t have reputation for violence.
