For the love of god, just call these "Spots" on bodies what they ARE. Penis (not pee-pee, doodle or wee-wee), Vagina (not coo-caa, hoo-ha, fanny (according to aussies and uk) or va-jayjay). They shouldÂ be considered shameful or embarrassingÂ words, and they aren't dirty body parts (unless you never shower of course). If I have children, I have Always vowed that I will teach them the normal words for their body parts. Hearing the wrong terms for these body parts (or having parents treat them as if they're dirty) just rubs me the wrong way.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/usj38</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/c8h7</id></website><link>http://stfuparents.tumblr.com/post/215633743</link><postedTime>2009-10-17T18:03:03+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-12-09T07:06:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/erigwq</id><link>http://stfuparents.tumblr.com/post/215633743#comment-382680235</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2009-10-17</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
