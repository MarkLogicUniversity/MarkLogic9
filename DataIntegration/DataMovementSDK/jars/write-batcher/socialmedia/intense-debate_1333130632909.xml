Right now, I'm liking Perry. Â I've been hoping for a while he would step forward.  Plain speaker. Â Has no problem outing Obama out for the colossal liar and job destroyer  he is. Â For the NIGHTMARE he is.  A successful Governor (which is what we need...not a 'fake chosen one' who served for 10 minutes in the Illinois Senate,  a radical and ex-community organizer who stold his election form one of his 'own people' and who voted 'present' so as to not 'leave a trail'.)  But he left horrendous d a m n i n g , videos which out him as a progressive, liberal radical that McCain and the lame stream press NEVER USED TO VETT THIS PRESIDENT. Â Sarah Palin (a superior Governor) who should have been in the White House (save for being strapped to the back of a spineless RINO whose lips couldn't form the words Marxist, Socialist or communist) now going on her third year is not out of the running yet. Â Yes sure, she's nearly been destroyed by a well planned, well funded team of assassins because she's a threat to progressive liberal ideology. Â But Palini keeps grinding her high heel into Obama's instep and running over his feet with her bus and she will Always be my choice. Â  If not, she'll continue to rain over Obama like a ton of bricks...destroy her? Â No, they created a fire breathing monsters. Â 

Mr. ACORN, is that your dumb a s s , singed by one little 'empty headed', lady from Wasilla, that we smell Burning?

I like Michelle Bachmann who plants herself right in front of the camera and outs Obama as a thief and liar every time she speaks. Â  Can you even imagine this awful President in a debate with Bachmann?   No more RINO'S. Â No Wienercrats. Â November 6 will be the new Independence Day from a tyrant and from big gov or this nation will refuse the alternative to this 'vacationer in Chief' and to all of his stifling, intrusive KGB policies.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/gnvcdi</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/mitt-romney/2011/06/19/mccain-graham-rip-romney-foreign-policy</link><postedTime>2011-06-19T18:22:19+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-06-19T19:46:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/cosi9w</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/mitt-romney/2011/06/19/mccain-graham-rip-romney-foreign-policy#comment-229960618</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8nldh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-06-19</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
