Their losing streak early in the season was interesting but I was not in the least surprised with the losing streak recently with no Howie, no Big E, no Lidstrom, no Kindl and no Helm. Am I missing anyone? Loss to the Isles and Leafs? Happens a lot. Leafs Always get up for the game against the Wings and the Isles they've lost I think 4 straight to them and 2 of them the Isles kicked their butts.Â 

Nyquist was either going down to the 3rd or 4th or not playing. Franzen has earned his Spot and needs a guy like Pavel. The other top line, youÂ aren'tÂ breaking them up they've been your best line for a while now. Babcock's not going anywhere. You fire him when someone better is available and I don't know of anyone.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ztq6j</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcj1</id></website><link>http://thehockeywriters.com/red-wings-mike-babcock-drawing-sharp-criticism/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:26:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:47:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3b97c</id><link>http://thehockeywriters.com/red-wings-mike-babcock-drawing-sharp-criticism/#comment-479751231</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8o151</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
