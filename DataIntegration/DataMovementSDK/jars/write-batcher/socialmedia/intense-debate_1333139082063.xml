Bottom line though is Zimmerman should be behind bars, even if Trayvon jumped him as he said , it was only because Trayvon was trying to stand his ground against a weirdo with a gun.... Zimmerman was told not to pursue and in doing so he ended a young mans life with his aggression.Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ld22m</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/jpbk</id></website><link>http://theweek.com/article/index/226064/trayvon-martin-vs-george-zimmerman-what-really-happened</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T22:45:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:15:51+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3se7q</id><link>http://theweek.com/article/index/226064/trayvon-martin-vs-george-zimmerman-what-really-happened#comment-480191887</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
