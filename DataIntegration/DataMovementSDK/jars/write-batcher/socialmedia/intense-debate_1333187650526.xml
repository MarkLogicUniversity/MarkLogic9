And then I would start up a few businesses.  For instance, I remember hearing a story about a man who won the lottery who bought a hotel, moved in to the top floor, and has himself set up so that he rents out the below rooms and has housekeeping clean his home for life.   I'd also want to start up a 24/7 comic book store/geek hangout/wi fi hot Spot/coffee shop so that people have a decent place to hang out.  I'd also make sure we had some decent guns there in case some dipshit tried to rob the place.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67c90t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/v6k</id></website><link>http://www.iheartchaos.com/post/20167978975</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:00:33+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:11:07+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwl9ax</id><link>http://www.iheartchaos.com/post/20167978975#comment-480963801</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/d41kz</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
