Maybe thats why Afican Americans don't like you. There are racist people in all groups no one is arguing that but to pretend that just because laws changed (civil rights Act) that people's mindset about blacks changed is crazy. Whole black communities were Burned to ground ex. Tulsa, Rosewood in the 20th century. Blacks were considered subhuman, not given equal protection, lynched, Burned all in the 20th century. Go look at videos of black soccer players having to deal with the field being littered with bananas in other countries.

Â Hell, go look at the different emails that members of congress have sent referring to Obama. Let's not pretend that black folk are just imagining racism. I guess the noose hangings by NYC firefighters and a Newark, NJ firefighter and the church burnings after Obama was elected is all about playing the race card. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ztxr5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/us/florida-teen-shooting-sanford-divided/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:29:13+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:54:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31msk</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/us/florida-teen-shooting-sanford-divided/index.html#comment-479820559</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ydza0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
