Â It's getting to be a little warm for me. Â Fortunately, the seats I got for Wednesday's game were in the shade. Â And so, it was perfect.
I'm not familiar with Don and Charlies, Doc. Â 
We had brekkies/lunch at "Mango" on Main St., where the waiter warned us it was gonna be a hot one.
After the game we heard the world's biggest "Mighty Wurlitzer Organ". Â That was my wife's choice and it was unique. Â I'll say that.
Ran into lots of very nice folks in Mesa. Â I'm gonna try to get back there.

Speaking of places to go, Doc, yesterday we had a snack at Ruby's at the end of the pier in  City. Â Saw a bunch of dolphins  the end of the pier. Â I have never seen that in HB before. Â 

Also saw a sea lion cavorting Off the pier, and some paintball aficionados on the beach. Â An interesting cultural mixture.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/678uwy</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/m9pw</id></website><link>http://viewfromthebleachers.com/blog/2012/03/30/james-russell-terrible-starter-pretty-good-reliever/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:05:46+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T10:01:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwoxju</id><link>http://viewfromthebleachers.com/blog/2012/03/30/james-russell-terrible-starter-pretty-good-reliever/#comment-481704755</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
