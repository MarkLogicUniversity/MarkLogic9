Progressive SPIN.?? YES
" I Used Progressive, as I was Corrected on Use Of Democrat."
Still Waiting to Being Informed as to Difference.....

Before You Get Too Hot on My 1st Line, GOP Uses SPIN Too, In Order to Stir Up Their Base, &amp; I Question Them TOO....

All This "War On" CRAP, Really Pi__es Me Off. Most People Who Come Up w/These Slogans Have NEVER Seen WAR....

Please Provide Me w/Positive Results from ANY of These Political Miss Uses of "War On." YOU CAN NOT... None Exist.

Really NOW, Is "Birth Control," a Function of Government.?? IF SO, Why NOT Go "Whole Hog," &amp; Do what China Does.?? Limit the Number of Children per/Couple....

When You BLAME, Karl Rove &amp; Rest, Don't Forget to Include the Democrats/Progressives Who Have done Same Thing. 

This IDEA That Politics Is a GAME &amp; We Should Choose Up Sides IS STUPID... You &amp; Me,"We the People" are Just Cannon Fodder for the Politician Trying to Get or Retain POWER Over the Masses.....

Use REASON, You Say, to Combat those You Disagree With.

Is It Reasonable to List Fox News &amp; Limbaugh, W/Out Listing MSNBC &amp; Chris Mathews &amp; BIG MOUTH Ed Schultz.??

Is It Reasonable To Say, Someone Who Objects, for Reasonable Reasons, MUST Pay for Abortions of People who are Using Abortion as Birth Control, When There are Many Ways to Prevent Pregnancy, and ARE AFFORDABLE.??

Some Other Time, I will Gladly Debate REASON w/You, But This Is Getting Long, &amp; I Think My Main Reply to Your Post Has Been Made... BTW, This Is NO Attack... Just Opinion..
