I don't think people who make their living  natural resources like fishing are less human than those who live Off oil. Â Yes, we human critters have to Heat our homes, but we also have to eat. Â I personally prefer local seafood to pink slime and weekold veggies from Mexico, but that's just me.

Do you and your kids eat food too, PeterB2?? Â I suspect the answer is yes.

I could take your post more seriously if you conceded that there was more to meaningful human economic activity than keeping the building warm...and not parroting the latest Hannity report from your living room in Kansas. Â The fishermen were here LONG before the oil men were, and they have rights that predate Shell's....so suck it up.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h9eab</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dneq</id></website><link>http://www.adn.com/2012/03/28/2395357/shell-wins-federal-approval-of.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T18:02:44+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:06:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3jaas</id><link>http://www.adn.com/2012/03/28/2395357/shell-wins-federal-approval-of.html#comment-479951636</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8in7z</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
