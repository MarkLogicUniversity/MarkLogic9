The petite smiling kid in the pic was over six feet tall now.   Why isnt the main stream media focusing on why the police COULDNT arrest him?  The police were against passage of this law because it would eventually lead to, well, this!  Instead of instigating riots,"black power", black  panther Bounties, Burning buildings etc etc blacks should be focusing on why the law is ridiculous and should be repealed.  I hate to say it, but it's making the black movement look awefully superficial.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/66n338</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/oudr</id></website><link>http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2012/03/23/opinion/doc4f6d2bfa2b893395706487.txt</link><postedTime>2012-03-24T03:20:12+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:13:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk1m2g</id><link>http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2012/03/23/opinion/doc4f6d2bfa2b893395706487.txt#comment-476460149</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/r5wu4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
