Your family either married a Native American or Not, with all your money you can't do the research?!! Know the truth before you speak!! And no one with NATIVE blood would wear something that would shame his people like that foolish headdress!! This is 2012 Hollywood wake up, no other ethnic group will tolerate this type of slander and we're not putting up with it any longer either!! Looks like a good movie to NOT SEE for the Native community!!  L.M. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/y07j5l</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mtxn</id></website><link>http://edit.hollywoodreporter.com/node/297732</link><postedTime>2012-03-08T20:18:02+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-20T14:08:46+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mjwgu3</id><link>http://edit.hollywoodreporter.com/node/297732#comment-470206509</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-08</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
