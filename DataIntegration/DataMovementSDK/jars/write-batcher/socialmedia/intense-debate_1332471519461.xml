Last year was probably one of the worst years of our life. My husband had nearly 12 months  work with a hip injury. He was unable to run his business and had a total hip replacement in August. They helped us through this tough time, encouraging us and giving us so much help. Then to top it Off we had Dux quest plumbing leaking through our house, we had floors caving in down our hallway a floor that rotted out in the bathroom and kitchen and water leaking out of weatherboards on the outside of the house I rang them one day in tears and they helped us to navigate through this as well, we were able to increase our mortgage to get the needed repairs. I don't know what I would have done without their help , nothing was too hard. Thanks Jill and Christine for all you have done xoÂ
