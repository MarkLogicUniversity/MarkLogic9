Example: picking up Chris from elementary school, I would leave Jonny in his booster seat with the doors locked (he can open from inside if he needed me) if it was raining and I was standing 50 feet away, watching him the whole time. I also leave my kids (8 and 5) in the locked car if I forget something in the house and have to run just inside the door. Its not like I'm leaving them unattended, even though they are in a car and I'm outside, since I can Reach them in less than 5 seconds. I wouldn't leave them in the car to go into any store (except to pay for gas)</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hpfu6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/uarm</id></website><link>http://www.8bitdad.com/2012/03/28/pqotw-do-you-ever-leave-your-toddler-alone-in-the-car-13389/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T20:39:25+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:16:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3jmsy</id><link>http://www.8bitdad.com/2012/03/28/pqotw-do-you-ever-leave-your-toddler-alone-in-the-car-13389/#comment-479960505</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
