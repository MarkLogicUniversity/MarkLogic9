Libs, particularly method- libs, are trained to be uncertain.   When you are uncertain of your own motives and abilities you are then doubly uncertian and nervous about other people's motives and abilities.  It breeds nothing but doubt about everyone and everything around you.  America is a terrible place because of the motives (that current people ascribe to) those of the Founders.  'If only they had self examined themsleves with the same gusto that 'method' actors strip bare their own souls our nation woould be pure.'. But as it is, we are fruit of a poisoned tree that must be hated, Burned and regrown with pure and cleansed roots.

Libs kind of suck.  

Long live Duke Wayne and best wishes to Chris Mitchum in his quest for Congress.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zfel0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ju4p</id></website><link>http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2012/03/28/mitchum-son-blacklisted-fonda-sutherland</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:24:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T03:25:16+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwuspk</id><link>http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2012/03/28/mitchum-son-blacklisted-fonda-sutherland#comment-481485811</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h0byt</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
