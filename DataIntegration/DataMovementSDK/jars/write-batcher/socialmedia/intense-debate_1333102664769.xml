As you repeatedly reminded us, there is so much at stake in this election. We are in danger of losing the very thing we hold most sacred - our liberties and freedoms!Â  This is not funny to me.Â  Why do you insist on fueling the Obama engine?Â Mitt Romney isÂ a good man who is determined to restore America's greatness. He deserves better than this. Why don't you try getting behind him and giving him the endorsement he deserves?!Â You personally are making it more difficult for him to do the very thing you have been preaching.Â You need to get Off the Santorum train!Â Yeah, okay...let's all rally behind the LOSER instead of someone with a track record of SUCCESS!Â Have you really examinedÂ Santorum's voting record?Â Do you want a President who swears at the Press because he can't take the Heat, but insists on "taking one for the team"?!Â  REALLY?Â  Wake up Glenn!Â Â Sorry to be the one to break it to you, but ...SantorumÂ is NO George Washington!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6znloz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rb19</id></website><link>/2012/03/29/mitt-romney-make-another-elitist-faux-pas/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:29:44+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:58:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3jwpe</id><link>/2012/03/29/mitt-romney-make-another-elitist-faux-pas/#comment-479995386</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzn4c</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
