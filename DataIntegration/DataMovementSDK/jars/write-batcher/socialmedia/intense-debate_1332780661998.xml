Now Nick Parker and Devin Thomas understand that drill.  They hit the hole full speed and wedged a crease into a gash for a couple of yards when nothing was there and hit full speed through the hole when it was wide enough.  

Scott is a great scat back and will get plenty of touches but i believe that the big pounding workhorses are what makes and breaks our running game.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rsn5h</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mkgx</id></website><link>http://blogs.clarionledger.com/um/2012/03/26/video-ole-miss-rebel-drill/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T13:34:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:13:00+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkfcxq</id><link>http://blogs.clarionledger.com/um/2012/03/26/video-ole-miss-rebel-drill/#comment-476502391</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8qvu2</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
