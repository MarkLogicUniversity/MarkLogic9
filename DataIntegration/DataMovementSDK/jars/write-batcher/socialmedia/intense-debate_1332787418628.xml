If you're going to wheel out the financial arguments, being obese is actually socially beneficial.

Now that might be a Cold logic, and I don't actually subscribe to it. However, frankly, it's less Cold than your position that the NHS should cease to take decisions based on medical need but on moral worth - morality based on how much people eat, (as well as what their metabolism is). 

You normally are utterly opposed to anything which might hint of doctors influencing who lives or dies, but I suppose that goes out of the window when it's a chance to make sure proles who 'read magazines, drink Coke and watch telly' die sooner.

As for your question: 'Does the obese 30-something lay claim to NHS services and a hospital bed
 when this means thousands of others will have to do without?'

Really? One obese person or 'thousands' of others? They're big, but not that big.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6roj2e</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ms5i</id></website><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/cristinaodone/100146838/why-should-fat-people-take-precedence-over-the-elderly-in-the-nhs/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T10:02:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:38:00+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk9qz7</id><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/cristinaodone/100146838/why-should-fat-people-take-precedence-over-the-elderly-in-the-nhs/#comment-476569527</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/celos</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
