Â  Q. Why did Zimmerman follow?
Â  Â  A. Â  Because that was his job as the Neighborhood Watch person. Â As soon as the 911 operator told him to back , he did.

As for whether the kid deserved to die, that Depends on what the kid did to Zimmerman.

If you believe the Race Wh0res, he was skipping merrily along singing Kum-Ba-Ya when Zimmerman gunned him down in Cold blood in a fit of white supremacist rage while frothing at the mouth and pining about Christianity.

If you believe the police report, then Martin got exactly what he deserved since he was trying to klll Zimmerman at the time.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zc2ew</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/29/george-zimmermans-father-claims-trayvon-martin-beat-his-son-threatened-his-life/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T05:39:13+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:33:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3fc2e</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/29/george-zimmermans-father-claims-trayvon-martin-beat-his-son-threatened-his-life/#comment-479860854</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h32uv</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
