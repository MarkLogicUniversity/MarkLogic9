I thought he had his head bashed in and a broken nose? It is reported that he was 'cleaned up' at the scene but wonder where is the bandage for his broken nose?Â hmmmm I guess in Flordia when they clean you up, they clean your clothes too? I've never had a broken nose, but I wound think that your nose would Bleed onto your clothing, no? By the recent video released by ABC News, Zimmerman doesn't look like someone who was severaly beat ( head bashed into the sidewalk)Â ...by a thug. And that is another point, if Trayon was a thug, as many have 'assumed ' him to be, I'd think that he would have been carrying some type of weapon. I mean, he's a bad guy right? Most bad guys'Â who areÂ  up to no good' carry some type of knife or gun or something right?? I guess it was his day Off..</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rmene</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/25/is-momentum-in-trayvon-martin-case-swinging-toward-george-zimmerman/</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T08:01:09+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:02:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3qblx</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/25/is-momentum-in-trayvon-martin-case-swinging-toward-george-zimmerman/#comment-479605989</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
