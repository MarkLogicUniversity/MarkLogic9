I could kick myself in the butt knowing what I know now asÂ I had a drum barrel full of 78's growing up given to me by my grandpa, who was a traveling and on radio fiddle player,Â  Had every kind of music.,Â  One cut I would love to have back is an original in the sleeve of "Homer and Jethro with June Carter, before anyone had ever heard of her doing "Baby its Cold Outside."Â  Have no idea of what happened to all of them, but probably back then they got put in the closet with the advent of 8 track, and eventually tossed not realizing the value they would come to have.Â  Still have a lot of 33's in the original sleeves that are mint.Â  I still listen to them picking out the guitar parts to learn a solo version of a song

As great as Chet was and other great players are or were, they didn't quit learning other genres or couldn't beÂ  influenced.Â  He played with Mark Knopfler to Lenny Breau and others and incorporated their styles into his.Â  He felt once can't learn and be influenced by great artist it is time to make a wall hanging of the guitar.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hptwu</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/eid</id></website><link>http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/the-scoreboard-tuesday-march-27-2_b118695</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T20:29:53+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:27:19+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3t8qf</id><link>http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/the-scoreboard-tuesday-march-27-2_b118695#comment-479487013</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/9emg</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
