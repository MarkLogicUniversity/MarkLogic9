Wow folks... this again? Talk about playing judge, jury and executioner. For those of you who have a problem with a portion of your taxes going toward public safety services, may I kindly suggest you adopt a more proactive approach and at least do some research before suggesting extremes such as shutting down the trails and forcing those who are rescued to â€œreimburseâ€&#157;us taxpayers.  Or go a step further and do something about itâ€”vote.  What is the actual dollar amount you personally think you would be owed as reimbursement for this rescue?  As far as shutting down public access to Bishop Peak?  You have absolutely no right to do so.  What makes you think you should be allowed to control the activities of someoneâ€™s daily lifeâ€¦ if not Bishop Peak it will be a different trail. Heck, maybe all the avid rock climbers will take up  and then we can all moan and groan about the increase in marine rescues and the tremendous costs to us poor taxpayers at the hands of those hippy, ill-experienced surfers. Did you know that San Luis Obispo has its own Underwater Search and Recovery Dive Team?  I bet those guys could use some more action.   This is why a portion of our taxes go toward public safety.  If a house Burns down three miles from your own home do you ask to be reimbursed due to the fact that it wasnâ€™t YOUR home and a portion of your tax dollars go to Cal Fire? Furthermore, if you received your education in another state and have no children in Californiaâ€™s public school system, are you irate that more than 50 cents of every dollar in our stateâ€™s budget goes toward education? Heck, if you have worked hard your whole life and  paid your taxes in general, how do you like that in just over one year roughly $12.6 BILLION dollars has gone to support the Medi-Cal system.  But no, noâ€¦ I see your point, letâ€™s shut down Bishop Peak.  If we donâ€™t Act now California will be bankrupt from the half-dozen hikers who slip and fall every year whilst trying to get some fresh air, a nice view and a little exercise. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vg4rk</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yzhm</id></website><link>http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2012/03/31/2012609.html</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T00:00:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T07:02:33+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0j6jf</id><link>http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2012/03/31/2012609.html#comment-483323461</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dyhcr</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
