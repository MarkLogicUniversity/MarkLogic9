I also wanted to travel until I met my partner and had 4 children who are now old enough for me to travel but I don't feel the same urge now.I do, however, wish I could move from the city I live and find a place near the sea but I still worry about my Â 'children' as they want to stay where we are.I've Always done what's right for family and friends to my detriment and don't seem to be able to change even though I know I need to.
I also dislike my career choice and I'm considering a direction change.I often wonder if my ongoing Back pain is due to all this.
