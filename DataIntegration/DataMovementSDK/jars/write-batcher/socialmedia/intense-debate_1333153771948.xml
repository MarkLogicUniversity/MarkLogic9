People's memories are somewhat short so the left offsets their ongoing failure to improve anyone's lot (except their own) by saying - It was worse under the Capitalists and holding up subtly altered graphs to prove it.
We can clearly see this in Global warming scam graphs. Past temperatures are altered downward and only hot location data (airports, cities) is used for current temperature. This gives a false impression of a century long Heating trend.
The "new economic normal" is a similar effort. It blames all our current woes on our rapacious past and I expect to soon see the graphs to prove we have never had it better than we have it now.
In short- Viva Obaba.
