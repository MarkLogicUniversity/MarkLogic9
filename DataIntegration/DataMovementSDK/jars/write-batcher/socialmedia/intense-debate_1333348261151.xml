Â for tomas he just doesn't care if bodies will be washed out to sea every time it rains or body bags for Burn victims are needed in plentiful when there is fire because of lack of fire equipment or all of the city streets become a big pothole as long as he has a hand in disposing of the srp properties. Â that is why he only wanted to start selling srp only when he gets back to city Hall as mayor which is wishful thinking since mayor mike is here to stay. Â i don't even think he is healthy enough to last that long. Â enough already please "no mas tomas" Â  Â Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vbea4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4s93</id></website><link>http://50.28.66.118/node/214399</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T16:50:26+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-01T20:10:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0b7vp</id><link>http://50.28.66.118/node/214399#comment-483096269</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/o468</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
