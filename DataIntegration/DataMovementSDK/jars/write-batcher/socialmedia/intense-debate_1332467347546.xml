A misguided attempt to change the subject and the information by not adding any information just suppositions. 


There are two qualifications of this study that tend to limit its application. First, it studied 34 Chinese cities. 

For some reason not listed studying Chinese cities is not appropriate when  making a study on EVs in China?

"UT Researchers Find Chinaâ€™s Pollution Related to E-Cars May Be More Harmful than Gasoline Cars"

As the first 'Qualification" this is moronic.  Unfortunately it does not get much if better


"Secondly, it was a study of particulate matter.

Different Kinds of Pollution
There are many kinds of pollution. Automobile Pollution is known for NOx (which eventually changes into smog), carbon dioxide, carbon Monoxide, and various other emissions. The particulate level of gasoline engines is relatively low and one of the reasons we donâ€™t use as many diesel engines is that the particulate level is higher for that fuel. Coal pollution, however, is high in particulates. If the study had, instead of particulates, measured CO2, NOx, or carbon monoxide, the reverse results would likely have been found."

Apparently the only proper studies are ones that ICE are worse than EVs.
Any pollution that EVs are worse in are some how wrong.

 "Nothing to see here just move along."

If the study had, instead of particulates, measured CO2, NOx, or carbon monoxide, the reverse results would likely have been found."

Well other studies have been done in China an CO2, Sulfur, and NOX
 EVs produce more of Sulphur and NOX in all parts of China and CO2 in some parts of China. As well as PM. (Particulate Matter)
This isn't mentioning the   Mercury, Lead, Arsenic and a host of others coal plants produce; but those wouldn't be proper studies either.


"In this case, the study has a narrow subject matter: particulates. Its conclusion is further limited to those places where coal is a very large percentage of the electrical energy mix. The US national electrical energy mix for coal is now around 43%. The other nations of the world that have an energy mix that relies so heavily on coal is Australia and South Africa."

I will add India southeast Asia and the islands (Indonesia) to that list.
Where have the manufacturing jobs gone too? Areas with cheap labor and cheap energy. 
Gee where is the greatest amount of new coal usage coming from?

"It is also a snapshot in time."

Thats true as you mentioned China is building a coal plant a week
Is that going to help make EVs cleaner?


 The electric car is not the problemâ€”power plants are.It would be hazardous to rely upon the study for any future course of action without considering the trend of the electrical energy mix. In the US, the electrical energy mix for coal has gone from 55% to the present 43% in the last 8 years. In the EU, 70% of new power capacity in 2011 was from renewables.


This whole piece is just a silly mess.

Nope if you don't use the energy the power plant does not produce it. No pollution, as I said just silly

True. Trends in global energy mix?
Globally CO2 per kWh has increased 50% since 1990.
Cherry picking areas as you do below doesn't cut it.

"In the US, the electrical energy mix for coal has gone from 55% to the present 43% in the last 8 years. In the EU, 70% of new power capacity in 2011 was from renewables."


Cherry picked data as you did there is not the subject of the study, China remember? Not the US or renewables in Europe.


"As the grid becomes cleaner over time, the EV is best positioned to take advantage of that change. "

Also will be the worst hit as most of the world is increasing their coal to grid use.

One other gem.

The study also concludes that â€œelectric cars are more harmful to public health per kilometer traveled in China than conventional vehicles.â€&#157; The important qualification is â€œper kilometer traveledâ€&#157; and â€œin China.â€&#157; With fewer electric cars, the impact is less. 

True but by this logic there will be less ICE in the future there for they will make less pollution and we should switch back from EVs to ICE as there will be less on the road and therefore cause less pollution. 

"In other locations, the study results will not be valid."

Possibly that is why the study names China not Global.
Also why your using information from the US and Europe was inappropriate as well.


An electric car, at least, has the possibility of using a clean source for its energy charge, but an internal combustion engine is Always going to be Burning something and producing pollution no matter what the fuel.


Yes and when you have a cleaner grid EVs may be cleaner.
At present however no. 
EVs are an environmental disaster on China's US's and Europe's grids.
