It all gives the edge to a "lesser" team......just watched an FA Cup game at a Non League home pitch.....the excitement is the same.....and "the fought" is awesome....

Barcelona didn't need to complain, it's just part and parcel of football.......with another side of beauty to be witnessed.......hard fought win.....

Nobody likes to watch a one-sided game.....me, I prefer the hard fought game.....so even though I am not a Milan fan, the match in San Siro was entertaining to me......

Lay it Off Barcelona, don't be such a Cry baby.....</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zl1j9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/y62v</id></website><link>http://www.espnstar.com/football/champions-league/news/detail/item777888/Barca-cry-foul-over-Milan-pitch/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:51:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:58:22+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ksbh</id><link>http://www.espnstar.com/football/champions-league/news/detail/item777888/Barca-cry-foul-over-Milan-pitch/#comment-480179173</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
