I don't think it's a "Dallas" thing as much as you might want to make it be.

Quite frequently, communal tables (done well) are in dense, urban centers where space is very limited. The places might even borderline on being cool, hip, eclectic and so on. Maybe even catering to a younger 25-45 foodie crowd.

In Dallas, we've got space. Lots of it, which is good and bad. But not too many restaurant are "small" or resemble the dense, urban little eateries that can be found in other cities. So diners here, just might not be as acclimated with seeing it too often.

I'm probably guilty of it too. At a little bistro in NYC or a Spot in San Francisco, you're like "ohh, how intimate" or "ambiant". Here, at home, you just want some fuckin' space.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67l7e5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rpf1</id></website><link>http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/cityofate/2012/03/can_dallas_not_handle_the_comm.php</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T19:48:06+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T21:31:05+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw4ykv</id><link>http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/cityofate/2012/03/can_dallas_not_handle_the_comm.php#comment-481222780</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
