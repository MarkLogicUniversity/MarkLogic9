I was absolutely shocked at the positions taken by the FoxNews people. They were so opposed to Zimmerman, that it seems they would fit right in with the â€œNew Black Panther Partyâ€&#157; leader.

Today, I caught a few minutes of Hannity, and I cannot believe the change in his attitude. While you wouldnâ€™t say that he was pro-Zimmerman, I believe you could say that he had moved to the middle and was saying wait for a â€œGrand Juryâ€&#157; to Act.

A week ago, I was asking myself what were these FoxNews people doing. Are they not supposed to be Conservatives/Rightists? Do they not realize how very important this incident is to the future of America? Why were they jumping to judgment with so little information? And, had they not even considered the concern about anti-gun activists and their agenda?

Today, Hannity had his â€œGreat Panelâ€&#157; on, and two of the participants keep demanding that Zimmerman be immediately arrested. But, that is a crazy position. A person is not arrested until there is sufficient evidence that he has actually committed a crime. And, the local police have stated that, so far, they do not have that level of evidence. But, these two kept insisting that Zimmerman be arrested and that a jury decide. One of them is supposedly Imusâ€™ wife. How can she be so stupid? That is not the way our system works.

However, at this point, I am asking myself, what could have occurred that caused Hannity to change his position so dramatically. Who â€œgotâ€&#157; to him?

We are being told that Zimmerman is Hispanic. We are also being told that he is Jewish. Some are saying that his mother is a Jewess from Peru. Others are saying it is his father who has the Jewish name of â€œZimmerman.â€&#157;

Yet, I have yet to see any Hispanic organizations coming to Zimmermanâ€™s defense. And, I ask myself why that is. Could it be that they are hoping the â€œWhiteâ€&#157; label sticks on Zimmerman, rather than the Hispanic label? But, even if Zimmerman is only half Hispanic, I would think Latino groups would be at least backing him a little.

And, what about the Jewish aspect? Well, I have read that George Zimmerman relates to being Jewish and is even a member of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League (ADL). And, I have read that four-or-five Jewish organizations are backing him. But, I have only read that at one Spot, and, certainly, the MSM is not talking much about it.

I will also note that, it is my opinion, both organized Latino, and Jewish, groups support stricter gun-control laws in America. Is that why they are not publicly backing Zimmerman?

In the end, I canâ€™t help but wonder what this is all about. Is there a lot more than meets the eye?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zo1zi</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t33k</id></website><link>http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/open-thread/otr-for-march-29-is-over-so-blog-what-you-think-about-tonights-news-show/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:58:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:23:47+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3s6os</id><link>http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/open-thread/otr-for-march-29-is-over-so-blog-what-you-think-about-tonights-news-show/#comment-480197552</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ltxoi</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
