Most ML players are pretty similar on a talent level. Of course you have your few superstars but most guys, it's how hard they work, how well they learn the game, and being in the right place at the right time and taking advantage of that timing.

People forget that most guys don't last long. We tend to focus on the Pujols, Fielder type contracts and forget that lots of guys are playing for the minimum (which granted is good money) or close to it. The average player scratches and claws to stay up,  back between the majors and the minors and lots of guys are gone in a couple of years. There's Always somebody just waiting to take your job or waiting for you to get hurt. It ain't for the Faint hearted.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r4g78</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120325%26content_id=27602598%26vkey=news_chc%26c_id=chc</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T21:06:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:08:00+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk152t</id><link>http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120325%26content_id=27602598%26vkey=news_chc%26c_id=chc#comment-476456273</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cszwo</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
