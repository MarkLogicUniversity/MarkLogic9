" It also had the misfortune of  as the face of the last few months of Foxconn scandal. Though the Foxconn protesters that threatened mass suicide back in January made Microsoft's XBox, thanks to Mike Daisey and Apple's financial successes, Apple not Microsoft absorbed most of the bad PR. "

Yes this is true but also you never heard anyone killing themselves in any of the Microsoft areas of foxconn its  apple like apple is doing something different to make these people flip (wonder what that could be?).  I think its all about how the company treats its people and I think most companies have standards which are greater than apple who makes harsher deadlines and has foxconn work its people harder with longer hours than other companies that use their service.

You mentioned the apple commercials.  I want to point out something about the new Ipad commercial.  It says "When a screen becomes this good" is very strange and apple like wording. This wording says to me that they don't even want to give the people that made the screen recognition.  It should have been worded "When a screen is made this good" which would say it was made by people.  Using the word "become" makes it sound like it miraculously out of magic (not by peoples hands) became better.  Its all psychology and how apple wants people to perceive their stuff and apple wants it to seem like magic made it and not human beings who sweat and Bleed making their stuff.
