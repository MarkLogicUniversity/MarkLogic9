We are in a gender war right now. There are woman dragged into the middle of the street and Burned alive in parts of the world. Noses hacked , faces Burnt with acid.... They are considered only to be on earth to bare children, tend a home and be quiet. It's not just about woman in a office trying to be like men, when in fact in many ways as proven we are better then, and shouldn't try to emulate what manners that are less then us. I do not care if the precious male ego is bruised by this reality. Time for the truth to come out.  I am not put Off by the differences between men and woman. Woman have so much to feel proud of that is uniquely ours. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/657c38</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mft1</id></website><link>http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/a_study_in_leadership_women_do.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-15T14:17:00+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-19T22:36:41+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mjtkfn</id><link>http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/a_study_in_leadership_women_do.html#comment-469447112</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-15</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
