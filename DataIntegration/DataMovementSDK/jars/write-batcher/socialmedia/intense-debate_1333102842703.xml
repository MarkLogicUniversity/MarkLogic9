Philistines drew near to attack Israel. But the LORD thundered with a 
mighty sound that day against the Philistines and threw them into 
confusion, and they were routed before Israel.Â  

Mmm! Love this! The Israelites were being obedient to the Lord and confessing their sins to Him and turning from them through the Burnt offering! And during that time, God protected them. He fought for them just as in EVERY battle they (and us) faced, it was God's power not their own (our own) that defeated their enemies (our sin)! God is PROTECTOR and that is SUCH a blessing! We have a God who is ALWAYS with us. Yesterday, today, tomorrow! He'll NEVER leave us and that is just AMAZING to know! I don't have to worry about anything because GOD is for me, so who can be against me!?
