1. Pakistan knew where he was and we know they're not our friend.  Period. 
2. Bin Laden was the limp dlck coward I  knew he was.  When the Heat got hot...he ran!  Which also means he was eating, drinking, and fcklng while sending others to do his dirty work.  
3. We sacrificed a lot of treasure and American Warriors looking in Afghanistan for a man who wasn't even there. I call that an intelligence failure.  
4. Liberal warfare doesn't does win, it prolongs it, and if the kid gloves would have come Off in the beginning...our men and women would have been home years ago.
