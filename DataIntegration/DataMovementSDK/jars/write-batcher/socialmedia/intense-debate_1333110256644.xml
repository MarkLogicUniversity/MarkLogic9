If this is slowly, I sure as heck wouldn't want to find out what REALLY slow would be like. Â 

I love this chart. Â It explains what a major economic disaster looks like. Â I also love the very last chart notation. Â Notice anything different? Â

The fact is this recession is nothing like the Great Depression with the exception that Liberals like Obama have doubled down on our debt. Â KeynesianÂ Economics has proven to be a complete failure. Â Not only is it a totally jobless recovery from a minor recession, we allowed Obama to drive us further in debt (ditch). Â He has nearly doubled what George Bush II did in 8 years, in three short years. Â That fact alone should garner him a Spot in theÂ GuinnessÂ Book of world records.
