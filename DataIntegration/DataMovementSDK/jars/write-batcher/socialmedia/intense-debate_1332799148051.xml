"Written out of our history books are the following facts. The Republican Party was started in 1854 as the anti-slavery party and, after the Civil War, Republicans amended the US Constitution to grant b lacks freedom (13th Amendment), citizenship (14th Amendment) and the right to vote (15th Amendment). Republicans then passed the civil rights laws to  bl acks could exercise their Constitutional rights, including the Civil Rights  of 1866, 1867 and 1875. After Democrats took control of Congress in 1892, Democrats passed the Repeal  of 1894 that overturned civil rights legislation enacted by the Republicans. It took Republicans nearly six decades to finally achieve passage of civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s pushed through by Republican Senator Everett Dirksen over the objection of the Democrats.

In addition to their reprehensible of record of fighting against civil rights legislation, Democrats have a long history of racial violence. Recorded by liberal professor Dr. Eric Foner in his book â€œA Short History of Reconstructionâ€&#157;, is the horrifying fact that Democrats started the K u K lux K lan in 1866 to ly nch and terrorize Republicans - bl ack and white. The K lan became the terrorist arm of the Democratic Party, kil ling over 2,000 bl ack Republicans and over 1,000 white Republicans.

The violence against the 1960s Era civil rights protesters was inflicted by Democrats. Democrat Public Safety Commissioner Eugene â€œBullâ€&#157; Connor in Birmingham let loose vicious dogs and turned skin-Burning fire hoses on b lack civil rights demonstrators. Democrat Georgia Governor Lester Maddox famously brandished a x handles to prevent b lacks from patronizing his restaurant. In 1954, Democrat Arkansas Governor Orville Faubus tried to prevent desegregation of a Little Rock public school. Democrat Alabama Governor George Wallace stood in front of the Alabama schoolhouse in 1963 and thundered, â€œSegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.â€&#157; "</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l8e9u</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/obamacare/2012/03/26/obama-lawyer-laughed-supreme-court</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:04:25+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T20:42:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkp3f2</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/obamacare/2012/03/26/obama-lawyer-laughed-supreme-court#comment-476728020</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rcm2j</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
