So, CNN, a "leader" of the Lap-Dog Media, have already decided that the Republican budget is "doomed." So, you at CNN now make the decisions for all 50 Senators? Gee, it's nice to know you finally admit it. The height of liberal arrogance...the Court of Fools (King Liar's supporters, the lap-dog media, and the leftist Dems/libs) have already decided to vote this down...and, the "party line" was obviously decided long ago: no matter what the Republicans propose, we'll just trumpet they're against old people, food, eating, breathing, living...and, the Court of Fools will believe us. They'll continue to vote for us. And, we'll have no worries. Wonder what you'll tell your Court of Fools when the money runs completely out? Oh, wait...you won't have to tell them anything. China will own and rule us. They already own us and are just waiting to call in the chits so they can rule us outright. Wonder what the lap-dog media will do then? Never mind...I know: they'll kow-tow to their Chinese masters just like they kow-tow to their Dem masters. I'm not sure who the bigger fools are: the poor, beknighted masses who support Obama and vote for him; or, you, CNN, and the rest of the lap-dog media who Vomit out to the masses the administration's lies. Oh, well...I'm of the age I won't be around to suffer much under China or whoever takes us over. I'll just watch from wherever I am (Heaven or Hell) and laugh my head Off! </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ztd7g</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/politics/house-gop-budget/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:12:53+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T01:33:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ixu0</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/politics/house-gop-budget/index.html#comment-480118319</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hjv5a</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
