Some have even published wild opinions about the 911 calls as if the opinions were factual statements.
Would you be surprised to know that the statements of the eyewitness are being censored in almost every media story about the shooting?1. When police officers arrived, George Zimmerman had a bloody nose and was Bleeding from a wound on the back on his head.2. The eyewitness who called 911 said Zimmerman who screamed for help.3. The eyewitness also reports that Zimmerman was on the ground and Martin was on top of him beating on him.
This information was made public by a local Orlando television station on February 27th. We now have 22 days of rampant media reports that omit these facts. Once you see what information the police had, it is obvious why they did not arrest him. They were simply abiding by Floridaâ€™s â€œStand Your Groundâ€&#157; law. Police are now required to have evidence that a shooter was not Acting in self-defense.
How many times have you heard the phrase â€œTrayvon Martin was a cheerful person,â€&#157; but you had never heard the words of the eye-witness to the shooting?
Each time you see a â€œmainstreamâ€&#157; news outlet rant about the Zimmerman/Martin case, ask yourself why these three facts mentioned above are missing from the story. Ask yourself why the media is called Zimmerman a white man instead of a Latino. Ask yourself if you think the story is really news or is it agitation/propaganda designed to advance a political agenda.
This past weekend in Chicago alone, black and Latino gangbabgers shot 10 people and wounded 40. The youngest fatality is only six years old. This received no national coverage. Why does this one shooting warrant weeks of coverage?
Even if you think Zimmerman was completely unjustified in firing his gun; ask yourself why 99% of the now thousands of articles are solely from the point of view of the grieving family without trying give a balanced account of the events.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ri8u6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dneu</id></website><link>http://www.bnd.com/2012/03/25/2114678/after-trayvon-martin-hoodie-goes.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T11:21:02+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T12:35:46+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkb56a</id><link>http://www.bnd.com/2012/03/25/2114678/after-trayvon-martin-hoodie-goes.html#comment-476363305</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ze2le</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
