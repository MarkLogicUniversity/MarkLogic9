To use the Suzuki Foundation (an activist environmental organization) as a source for climate statistics is just simply irresponsible, misleading and dumb. According to Hadcrut (UAH) one of the worlds leading meteorological information sources the global temperature has only increased about 7/10th of one degree Celsius in the last 100 years or about 30% less than that which was claimed in â€œ Winter Diedâ€&#157; lol... Imagine even 1 degree being scary.? Furthermore this small amount of warming could easily all be accounted for by the natural background noise of natural climate variability or the general natural warming which has been happening since the last ice age 17000 years ago. Don't worry winter will not disappear in Canada soon and never will because of manmade. C02 emissions,simply because significant man made global warming is a hoax and costly Eco-swindle. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6mmn63</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/r11g</id></website><link>http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/03/19/the-winter-that-never-was/</link><postedTime>2012-03-19T16:53:53+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T23:44:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/midk1z</id><link>http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/03/19/the-winter-that-never-was/#comment-474066014</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zd1ym</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-19</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
