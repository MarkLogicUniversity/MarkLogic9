Â I have been driving on the West Coast, including Washington, over 14,000 miles over eight years, and I have been pulled over exactly once, for a Burnt headlight, and despite smelling like freshly trimmed weed and having NORML stickers on my beat-up Jeep, he gave me a warning and sent me on my way. Â I just don't believe the risk of getting that blood draw increases post I-502.

Find me the current Washington State medical marijuana patient who meets all these criteria:
* Driven in the state over a year
* Been pulled over by a cop
* Been suspected of impairment
* Failed a sobriety test
* Was taken in for a blood draw
* The blood draw came in at &gt;5ng/mL
* The suspect was acquitted of DUID in court.

...because that's the person who is at risk under I-502. Â You mention the patient show can only afford a public defender... well, how does that patient escape a DUID at &gt;5ng/mL with a public defender? Â Please, show me the case! Â 100,000 patients, 13 years of medical marijuana, and nobody can find me that 5ng/mL driver acquitted of DUID?

I'll take you up on the challenge if you can provide me a fair counter. Â For instance, if I-502 passes, I'll make sure my ng/mL are above 5ng and drive the length of every freeway in the state and visit the city Hall of your five largest cities over the course of a year. Â In exchange, if I-502 fails, you find me 10,000 patients willing to drop their medical recommendations and carry around an ounce in their pockets at all times next year.
