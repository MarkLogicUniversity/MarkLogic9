The other teams started to get ready for the play-offs after the All-Star break.They increased thier intensity levels and started to play at a higher level. The Leafs were already playing to their max, and thus could not get any better.
Not long ago, when a player was doing a TV interview between periods, invariably the player would say, "well, during theÂ season, as long as we win one, lose one, we can keep up with the other teams". But at this time of the season, the better teams pull out all the stops to Gain position in the standings. So, teams like the Leafs and the Habs...........................crash and Burn!Â Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6776iy</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zsj8</id></website><link>http://www.torontosun.com/2012/03/30/leafs-truculent-whos-kidding-who</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T22:05:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:56:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwbugw</id><link>http://www.torontosun.com/2012/03/30/leafs-truculent-whos-kidding-who#comment-481426630</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hj1st</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
