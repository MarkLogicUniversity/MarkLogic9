For those who read the book (like me) there was some noticeable changes, but Director Gary Ross stayed very true to the work and he was faithful in his approach. My one criticism would be the overtly shaky camera work at the beginning of the film and throughout. I know he was trying for authenticity but it gave us all a Headache.Â  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r0xso</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dndz</id></website><link>http://www.macon.com/2012/03/26/1962990/locking-up-alcatraz.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:01:05+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:24:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkf6f3</id><link>http://www.macon.com/2012/03/26/1962990/locking-up-alcatraz.html#comment-476511621</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/comww</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
