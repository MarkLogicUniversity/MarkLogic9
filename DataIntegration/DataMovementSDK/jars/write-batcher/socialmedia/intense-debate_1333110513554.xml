If you aren't already an established player and under a big contract, you can't just not show up at all, like Gentry hasn't, and be on any kind of "track" to make the team. There must be at least some point of strength or some other merit to chose a player with not as good numbers, over another with better spring stats!Â "Aren't Always" is the word here. I didn't say the best candidate never wins out. Borbone isn't exactly Burning the woods down either, but he started strong. It would be pretty hard to chose Gentry's .103 BA, and his .188 OBP. over Borbons .238 BA, and his .347 OBP. Even as weak as Borbon's numbers are, Gentrys are just flat abysmal. No chance at all with those numbers!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h0ppq</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120328%26content_id=27715664%26notebook_id=27715666%26vkey=notebook_tex%26c_id=tex</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T02:20:30+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:21:43+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3p7vo</id><link>http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120328%26content_id=27715664%26notebook_id=27715666%26vkey=notebook_tex%26c_id=tex#comment-480063628</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g6h7y</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
