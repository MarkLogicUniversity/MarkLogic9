Do you think that was more of a coaching point in film study, or a Heat-of-the-moment "hey, I have an idea" move?

That leads me to my next point... I love Asante and he's the best -corner in the game, but is he limiting our defense?  It seems to me that teams try to expose his weeknesses (tackling, physicality).  He has been playing 6-8 yards  the LOS in 3rd and shorts.  I've Always been of the belief that top-shelf CBs should be able to play either side of the field, inside or out.  Are Samuel's limitations then limiting Asomugha and to a lesser extent, Rodger-Cromartie?  I hate suggesting we trade him, but it seems that he does not belong in this scheme and we have more glaring needs.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/mynwr9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xiyd</id></website><link>http://igglesblitz.com/philadelphia-eagles-2/monday-morning-hope/</link><postedTime>2011-10-10T16:30:36+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-10-10T17:25:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/gtcpl0</id><link>http://igglesblitz.com/philadelphia-eagles-2/monday-morning-hope/#comment-331062371</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7dsi</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-10-10</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
