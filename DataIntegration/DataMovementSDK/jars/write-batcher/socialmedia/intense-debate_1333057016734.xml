Bucketstealer...  So you're blaming Trayvon for Zimmerman stalking and then killing him.  Trayvon was under NO OBLIGATION to answer any questions for Zimmerman.  So Zimmerman gets to use the stand your ground,, but Trayvon doesn't?  A strange man is following your child in the dark and rain, what would you advise them to do?  C'mon, now people stop trying to blame the victim.  

I've been hit in my nose before and Bled all over the front of my shirt. My nose wasn't even broken. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO BLOOD ANYWHERE ON THIS MAN! The ENTIRE Sanford Police department should be FIRED IMMEDIATELY! This is just too much! If this video doesn't SCREAM COVER UP I don't know what does. Unbelievable!  Unbelievable that some of you people still think what this man did is justified.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zcxr4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:16:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:52:40+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m34hyc</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-479547543</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/xftd</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
