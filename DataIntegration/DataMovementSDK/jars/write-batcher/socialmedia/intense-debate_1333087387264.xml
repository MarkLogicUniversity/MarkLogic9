His lawyer must have told him to say that since they try to say that causes SIDS. I had 6 babies and everyone of them slept on their tummies,all night . This new idea of Drs is just that. A new idea.
Â When I had mine, many children had died of so called SIDS andÂ the parents were arrested for murder or negligenceÂ and in Every case that I heard of, the baby was lying on its back and choked on milk or Vomit,Â it spit up.Â inÂ 1960's to late 90'sÂ that is when Drs Always told us to put the babies on their tummies and raise the foot of the carriage or crib or bassinetjust in case they did throw up.Â Â 
Hopefullly this guy wont ever be allowed around any other children. especially babies that cant tell what really happened.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h01jv</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7mag</id></website><link>http://www.calgarysun.com/2012/03/28/man-admits-to-shaking-baby</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T02:10:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:42:05+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3fykh</id><link>http://www.calgarysun.com/2012/03/28/man-admits-to-shaking-baby#comment-479869753</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gb4yn</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
