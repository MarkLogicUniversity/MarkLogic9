Invading Afghanistan, murdering innocent 
people including women and children are bad enough, now US is refusing 
to cooperate with Afghan government to investigate this. How atrocious 
can you be?how cruel can you be? Â Are Muslims sub-humans that you can kill, murder, urinate and Burn their Korans? Â If
 16 innocent people were killed in the West under similar circumstance, 
even before the perpetrator was identified, the media would be full of 
stories of "islamic terrorist" attacks. But now everyone talks about a 
lone, troubled guy who just "snapped." Yes, I'm talking about you Mr. 
Media! Are you aware of your double standards? Â "Kill team" cuts Off
 fingers/other body parts of Afghans (including civilians) and wears 
them as "trophies" - American / ISAF Response: "This is an isolated 
incident that does not reflect American / ISAF troops deep respect for 
the people and culture of Afghanistan." Â Video emerges of American /
 ISAF troops urinating on deceased Afghans - American / ISAF Response: 
"This is an isolated incident that does not reflect American / ISAF 
troops deep respect for the people and culture of Afghanistan." Â Burning
 of Korans incident - American / ISAF Response: "This is an isolated 
incident that does not reflect American / ISAF troops deep respect for 
the people and culture of Afghanistan." Â American servicemen (or 
several according to the Afghan govt: why only Bales being charged and 
the others scot free?) go into homes and slaugter unarmed men, women and
 children - American / ISAF Response: "This is an isolated incident that
 does not reflect American / ISAF troops deep respect for the people and
 culture of Afghanistan." Â Somehow it's just not convincing anymore. Â It is hypocrisy at its US best. Â It is empty charade of US conceit. Â When
 US (UK and the like) talk, you can see they lie through their teeth 
with rhetoric and articulation of beautiful (but hollow) words with 
ulterior motives. Â Leopards donâ€™t change their Spots: US (UK and the like) are murderers: theyâ€™re emperors without clothes.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rpoq0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mxvm</id></website><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/british-troops-shot-dead-at-afghanistan-base-7585627.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T11:04:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:03:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk1av1</id><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/british-troops-shot-dead-at-afghanistan-base-7585627.html#comment-476452968</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8x6z9</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
