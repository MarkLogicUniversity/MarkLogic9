People believe these rumors and become outraged before they have any proof to back up the allegations. Some people believe Zimmerman is a racist b/c it appears he murdered Treyvon in Cold blood, but no one has any actual proof of how it happened. Some people believe that Treyvon was the aggressor and Zimmerman was Acting in self defense, but once again, no one knows for sure what exactly happened. 
Some people blame the media for stirring up the controversy, but that's only blaming the messenger. The only thing I know for sure is that if the police had only taken Zimmerman in to the police station and at least gotten a statement from him on the record, most of this controversy could have been avoided. I blame the Sanford Police Department for creating this ruckus and they are the ones who should be investigated, interrogated and protested. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r0w00</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/justice/florida-teen-shooting-poll/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:18:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:11:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkjctd</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/justice/florida-teen-shooting-poll/index.html#comment-476595548</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8d6zf</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
