Just wish to clarify that wireless access doesn't equate internet access. Internet can be accessed by hardwired computers, without the health risk of microwave radiation (wi-fi). I am a parent (a computer-literate one, too). I fully support having computer and internet access as part of my child's education, but I make sure that the technology is implemented in a safe manner. I understand parents' concern for children's academic development. I believe that most parents have the best intention when they acquire the wireless equipment for the children. However, in North America, the awareness about the potential health effects of such technology is very low. In case most readers are not aware, the microwave exposure limit in US an Canada is 1000 microwatts/cm2. The microwave exposure limits in countries like Switzerland, Italy, France, Luxembourg, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Austria and Israel are at 0.1 to 10 Î¼W/cm2. China and Russia have conducted large-scale microwave radiation studies on humans, and they set their maximums at 10 Î¼W/cm2.
In other words, the limit in all these countries are 100 to 10000 times lower than ours!
As a parent to a young child, I will definitely err on the side of caution. As testified by Dr. Annie Sasco, Director of Epidemiology at National Institutes of Health, at the Canadian House of Commons committee meeting on health effects of radiofrequency and microwave last year, â€œIf we want to wait for final proof, at least in terms of cancer, it may still take 20 years and the issue will become that we will not have unexposed population to  as control... But we have enough data to go ahead with a Precautionary Principle to avoid exposures which are unnecessary, if our goal is to reduce somewhat the burden of cancer in the years to come and other chronic diseases."

In 2008 and 2009, the European Parliament adopted two resolutions - by near-unanimous votes - to set stricter electromagnetic exposure limits and stated specifically: â€œwireless technology (mobile phones, Wi-Fi / WiMAX, Bluetooth, DECT landline telephones) emits EMFs that may have adverse effects on human health... particularly to young people whose brains are still developingâ€&#157;.

Below are a some studies that found biological effects from microwave radiation at Wi-Fi range (2.45 Ghz) frequency:

Mutagenic response of 2.45 GHz radiation exposure on rat brain.
"The authors conclude that the chronic exposure to 2.45 GHz microwaves may cause a significant damage to the brain, which may be an indication of possible tumour promotion."

Some behavioral effects of short-term exposure of rats to 2.45 GHz microwave radiation.
"Microwave-exposed animals exhibited less activity than sham-exposed animals... Both the locomotor activity and acoustic startle data demonstrate that, under the conditions of this experiment, microwave exposure may alter responsiveness of rats to novel environmental conditions or stimuli."

Effects of microwave at 2.45 GHz radiations on reproductive system of male rats.
"Chronic exposure to these radiations produced formation of apoptotic cells in testis. In addition, a significant decrease in the levels of GPx, and SOD activities as well as an increase in CAT activity was observed in the exposed group. These results indicate that a low level exposure of microwave radiations exerts a negative impact on male reproductive system function."

"Inhabitants living nearby mobile phone base stations are at risk for developing neuropsychiatric problems and some changes in the performance of neurobehavioral functions either by facilitation or inhibition. So, revision of standard guidelines for public exposure to RER from mobile phone base station antennas and using of NBTB (neurobehavioral test Battery) for regular assessment and early detection of biological effects among inhabitants around the stations are recommended."

Electromagn Biol Med. ;25(3):177-88Yurekli AI, Ozkan M, Kalkan T, Saybasili H, Tuncel H, Atukeren P, Gumustas K, Seker S (2006).
"When EM fields at a power density of 3.67 W/m2 (specific absorption rate = 11.3 mW/kg), which is well below current exposure limits, were applied, MDA (malondialdehyde - a marker for oxidative stress) level was found to increase and GSH (reduced glutathione, a major antioxidant) concentration was found to decrease significantly (p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, there was a less significant (p = 0.0190) increase in SOD (superoxide dismutase) activity (cell-repair) under EM exposure."

"Genotoxic effects and a modified expression of numerous genes and proteins after EMF exposure could be demonstrated with great certainty, while effects on cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death) were much less conclusive. Since all these observations were made in in vitro studies, the results obtained neither preclude nor confirm a health risk due to EMF exposure, but they speak in favour of such a possibility."

"Women significantly more often than men (p &lt; 0.05) complained of Headache, Nausea, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, depression, discomfort and visual perturbations. This first study on symptoms experienced by people living in vicinity of base stations shows that, in view of radio protection, minimal distance of people from cellular phone base stations should not be &lt; 300 m."

Possible Effects of Electromagnetic Fields from Phone Masts on a Population of White Stork (Ciconia ciconia).
Balmori Alfonso (2005).  Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine, 24: 109-119
"Total productivity (number of young per couple, including nests with 0 chicks) for nests within 200m of the antenna was 0.86 (0.7 - 1.02), whereas productivity for nests further than 300m away was 1.6 (1.46- 1.74). Both were statistically significant, with a p value of 0.001. A large part of the difference here appears to be due to the likelihood of the couples in the nests near the mast (cell tower) not having any chicks: 40% of those within 200m had no chicks, whereas in the nests greater than 300m away only 3.3% did not have chicks!Odd behaviour was also noted in the storks, happening much more frequently the closer the nests were to the masts."

Increased incidence of cancer near a cell-phone transmitter station.Wolf R, Wolf D (April 2004). International Journal of Cancer Prevention Vol1, No2  - [Download Report]
"The measured level of RF radiation (power density) in the area was low; far below the current guidelines based on the thermal effects of RF exposure. We suggest, therefore, that the current guidelines be re-evaluated. The enormous short latency period; less than 2 years, indicates that if there is a real causal association between RF radiation emitted from the cell-phone base station and the cancer cases (which we strongly believe there is), then the RF radiation should have a very strong promoting effect on cancer at very low radiation! Although the possibility remains that this clustering of cancer cases in one year was a chance event, the unusual sex pattern of these cases, the 6 different cancer kinds, and the fact that only one patient smoked make this possibility very improbable and remote. It should be noted that 7 out of 8 cancer cases were women, like in the work of Maskarinec (25) who found 6 out of 7 leukemia cases in proximity to radio towers to occur in girls. Such unusual appearances of cancer cases due to one accused factor on two completely different occasions is alarming."

The Microwave Syndrome - Further aspects of a Spanish Study.
Oberfeld Gerd, Navarro A. Enrique, Portoles Manuel, Maestu Ceferino, Gomez-Perretta Claudio (August 2004).  Conference Proceedings.
"All models showed statistical significant associations between the measured electric field (~ 400 MHz â€“ 3 GHz) and 13 out of 16 health related symptoms. The strongest five associations found are depressive tendency, fatigue, sleeping disorder, difficulty in concentration and cardiovascular problems. The symptoms associated are in line with the symptoms reported in the literature as â€œMicrowave Syndrom... Based on the data of this study the advice would be to strive for levels not higher than 0.02 V/m for the sum total, which is equal to a power density of 0.0001 Î¼W/cmÂ²...â€&#157;.

Some people might ignore these studies and choose instead to look at all the industry-funded studies to have "a peace of mind". Industry-funded studies mostly indicate that there are no adverse effects from electromagnetic radiation (remember the tactics of the tobacco industry?) http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1289%2Fehp.9149
