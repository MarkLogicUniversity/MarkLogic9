 This is not a "swaying bridge".  It will be a stone Cold iron post rigid bridge that adjusts to earthquake stresses.   It may be your safest Spot during a  earthquake.

As for "cost's"...how much of the bridge costs are being paid personally by you.  Would that be 0, as in Zero!   So what is your concern about costs...it's being paid by oil revenue...or if we are smart, by "future" oil revenue.

One trip over the bridge will change your mind when you experience the utter exhiliration of the ride itself.   Try it, you'll like it.  Once you do, you'll be Glad it was built...guaranteed!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lz7uc</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dneq</id></website><link>http://www.adn.com/2012/03/26/2392506/knik-arm-bridge-runs-into-senate.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T05:58:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T22:24:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwqyzc</id><link>http://www.adn.com/2012/03/26/2392506/knik-arm-bridge-runs-into-senate.html#comment-481268811</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8kx8z</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
