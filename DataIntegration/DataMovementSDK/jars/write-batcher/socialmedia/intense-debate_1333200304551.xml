Adobe is only charging for the use of their cross compiler that allows console games created in c++ and other languages to be ported to the Flash player.

Anything created in Flash using Actionscript even using Stage3D and the like will not be subject to this tax. Only games created on other platforms that want Adobe to merge to the Flash Player.

And that seems pretty normal to me. Doesn't Apple charge 30% for just handing developers content to ios users? that seems alot worse.

They are only charging the fee if you built your game using other tools, and then want to play it through the Flash Player using Adobe's new compiler option

Adobe does not charge for the use of the Flash player, only for their tools to create content.

If you're not going to use Adobe tools to build your game, but still want to deploy to the Flash player, shouldn't Adobe get something for all their hard work it took to make that possible for your game?

Oh, and Adobe will not charge anything if your game is deployed to an App like for IPad or Android, this only applies to browser games.

Don't want to pay it? Build your game using Adobe Tools.

All Apple does is hand content to ios users and takes 30%, you dont think this huge step from Adobe, which otherwise would not allow your game to exist isn't worth 9%</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hpvqm</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/txkp</id></website><link>http://www.informationweek.com/news/development/mobility/232700429</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T20:28:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:18:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwzms9</id><link>http://www.informationweek.com/news/development/mobility/232700429#comment-481033610</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7d6s</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
