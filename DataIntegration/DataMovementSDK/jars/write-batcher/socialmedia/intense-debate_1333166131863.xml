Love that he used &amp;quot;The Dark Knight&amp;quot; reference, and how he actually mentions that there have been difficult times in the WWE (making reference to drug and steroid scandals, premature deaths, and of course, the Benoit incident), and that he (rightfully) is the man who the WWE have chosen to carry the flag, to make it &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; to support wrestling still, and be a good role model. 
 
However, while some of the confrontations between Cena and the Rock have been Heated, and I don&amp;#039;t doubt that there is some (good for creative) friction between them, I think that him &amp;quot;disliking&amp;quot; the Rock is clearly kayfabe, and vice versa. I think they both really respect each other for doing what they&amp;#039;ve done in the past, and are doing now, and Cena was (and said as much) a big Rock fan. You only have to look at how nice they were to each other back in 2008 when Rock inducted his father and grandfather into the  of Fame, and how the Rock put him over, and Cena &amp;quot;tipped his hat&amp;quot; Off to him. It&amp;#039;s fun to think though that the seeds were technically planted all the way back then, and that this Sunday - it will all culminate at WrestleMania...Can&amp;#039;t wait.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:310642:127886206</id><idPostId>127886206</idPostId><idBlogId>310642</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:310642</id><idBlogId>310642</idBlogId><link>http://www.lordsofpain.net</link><displayName>LordsofPain.net</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/wwe/John_Cena_Interview_-_Why_He_Doesn_t_Like_The_Rock_Dispels_Super_Cena_Tag.html</link><displayName>John Cena Interview - Why He Doesn\'t Like The Rock, Dispels "Super Cena" Tag</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T03:54:22.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:310642:127886206:328245212</id><link>http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/wwe/John_Cena_Interview_-_Why_He_Doesn_t_Like_The_Rock_Dispels_Super_Cena_Tag.html#IDComment328245212</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T03:54:22.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on John Cena Interview - Why He Doesn\'t Like The Rock, Dispels "Super Cena" Tag by ripper48</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://intensedebate.com/people/ripper48</link><idEmailMd5>37b50d282f67bb26d7bb6c0337faa4e6</idEmailMd5><displayName>ripper48</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/people/ripper48"&gt;ripper48&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/wwe/John_Cena_Interview_-_Why_He_Doesn_t_Like_The_Rock_Dispels_Super_Cena_Tag.html"&gt;John Cena Interview - Why He Doesn\'t Like The Rock, Dispels "Super Cena" Tag&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
