I also will state that I am anÂ Atheist. I can hover give you insight why. You start by using yourÂ definitionÂ of aÂ Christian,Â whichÂ for the most part I wouldÂ acceptÂ thatÂ many of your faithÂ believe, you should follow, but that is a flawed argument. You have only oneÂ requirementÂ (most denominations) and that is accept Jesus as your lord and savior, and that he died on the cross so that your sins may be cleansed. That is not why people hate Christianity however, but this line I could truly say would give me a reason to dislike you as an individual "
I believe it is because they are told untruths by those that are so full of self that they cannot admit the existence of a creator and want to drag as many down with them as they can". You are assuming that there is a  plan to "take down the good little Christians". Have you ever thought that this is offensive to someone that doesn'tÂ believe? I meanÂ seriouslyÂ you don't know a thing about me yet you assume that I have a Secret Evil agenda, when in fact sir you could be farther from the truth. I can't brag to much about myself but there is one thing I can tell you and feel 100%Â accurateÂ about Â is that I am a good person, I love life, my fellow human, I am a great father, I even work in social services so that Â I can help people, besides the time that IÂ volunteerÂ at the local lodge, help myÂ neighborÂ with a project, or feed the stray cat that no one cares for, I am aÂ trulyÂ good person. I can tell you this as well I have read the Bible in factÂ that'sÂ why Â I do notÂ believe, there are so many things that I find immoral, and to be blunt, amazingly hard toÂ believe. I have also read several other text Â from other faiths as well as ChristianÂ apologeticÂ books. I can tell you this as well. Atheist outscored all other faiths in knowledge of the Bible. It was done by aÂ ChristianÂ research center (pew research) and it shows clearly thatÂ AtheistÂ know their Bible. Don'tÂ believe?Â simply search "who knows the bible pew research. Â Look at your own words man,Â objectivelyÂ and see for yourself why people get upset withÂ Christians, besides the fact that you insult peoples morality andÂ intelligenceÂ indirectly, the choice you give me is. God loves you, now follow him or Burn for ever. Sounds more like an ultimatumÂ to me.
