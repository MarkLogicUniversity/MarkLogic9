By accident I found a solution that seems to help.  I was talking to my sister on the phone, and she said that I was jumping around in the conversation so much that it was giving her a Headache trying to follow my conversation.   I had been accidentally given a prescription for short Acting Dexadrine when I called my dr.'s office for a refill of my Dexadrine ER.   I took a half of a 10 mg tablet and in a little while I seemed to calm down, and actually felt sleepy.  I went to bed that night before midnight, had the best night's sleep that I can remember and woke up feeling rested.  I thought that I was just weird having that kind of reaction.  I will be bringing this up to my doctor next week when I see her.  This article backs up my own experience.  Now if I could just remember to take it every night.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/8doel5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/deo8</id></website><link>http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/757-3.html</link><postedTime>2010-08-31T09:46:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:38:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwtmms</id><link>http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/757-3.html#comment-481172684</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2010-08-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
