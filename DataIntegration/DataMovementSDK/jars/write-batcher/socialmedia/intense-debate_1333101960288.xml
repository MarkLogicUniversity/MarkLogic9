One could say it's changing! It's happening in Europe and all over the US, it's almost like the whole globe is getting warmer! It's so weird and there's no explanation for this, no, none whatsoever.

This person is not a wingnut. But the way the discussion of global warming is shaped in America Ensures that action can never be taken, even if sea levels rise and engulf a state or two.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hkx16</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ydw9</id></website><link>http://motherjones.com/node/169546</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T22:01:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:30:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3brpi</id><link>http://motherjones.com/node/169546#comment-479732322</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5cyd0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
