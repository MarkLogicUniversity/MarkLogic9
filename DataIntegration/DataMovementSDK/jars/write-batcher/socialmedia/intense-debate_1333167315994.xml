He's a guy that just needs the Spring to get his throws in and his timing with his mechanics to be ready for 2012. Hitters can't sit on one pitch when facing Hellickson and wouldn't be surprised to see him develop another pitch at some point in his career. He still is mostly a fastball, changeup pitcher but still has good breaking stuff that he can throw in any count. Depending on this season he is another one that Freidman has to think about locking up quick before he prices himself out of Tampa. Even more important with Shields inevitably going to be dealt. IF he is it has to be for more offense. Just think where this club will be if and when they can get a couple more consistent bats in the lineup.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zxzhx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27729964%26vkey=news_tb%26c_id=tb</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:15:09+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T14:24:51+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwyap7</id><link>http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27729964%26vkey=news_tb%26c_id=tb#comment-480792435</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cszkh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
