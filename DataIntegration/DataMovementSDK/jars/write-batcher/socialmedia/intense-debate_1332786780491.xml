I bet the scouts wish they had your crystal ball or your knowledge of the game.  It would save them time by not drafting QB&amp;#039;s that will never do anything at the next level.  Bottom line, Tyler has the toughness, the vision, the intelligence and the arm to deliver the ball to the right Spot and on time.  And no, I don&amp;#039;t know of any of Coach Petrino&amp;#039;s QB&amp;#039;s that have done anything in the pros, (that really has nothing to do with Tyler&amp;#039;s ability or promise)  but I do think that Tyler is getting a fantastic education for the next level and will be very successful there.  David, my grandad told me on many occasions not to say anything about someone if I couldn&amp;#039;t say something nice.  Thanks for making me think of him and  his sound advice. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:186275:127412631</id><idPostId>127412631</idPostId><idBlogId>186275</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:186275</id><idBlogId>186275</idBlogId><link>http://www.arkansassports360.com</link><displayName>ArkansasSports360.com</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.arkansassports360.com/30421/sporting-news-nfl-scouts-disappointed-razorbacks-wilson-not-available-in-2012</link><displayName>Sporting News: NFL Scouts \'Disappointed\' Razorbacks\' Wilson Not Available In 2012 - ArkansasSport</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:31:48.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:186275:127412631:324986044</id><link>http://www.arkansassports360.com/30421/sporting-news-nfl-scouts-disappointed-razorbacks-wilson-not-available-in-2012#IDComment324986044</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:31:48.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Sporting News: NFL Scouts \'Disappointed\' Razorbacks\' Wilson Not Available In 2012 - ArkansasSport by RoyMac</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link/><idEmailMd5>dc5944176b3046f2f050ca162587dd9f</idEmailMd5><displayName>RoyMac</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>RoyMac commented on &lt;a href="http://www.arkansassports360.com/30421/sporting-news-nfl-scouts-disappointed-razorbacks-wilson-not-available-in-2012"&gt;Sporting News: NFL Scouts \'Disappointed\' Razorbacks\' Wilson Not Available In 2012 - ArkansasSport&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
