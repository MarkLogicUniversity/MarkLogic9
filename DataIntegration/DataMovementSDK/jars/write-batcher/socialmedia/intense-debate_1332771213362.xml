He finally got fed up and told the kid he was cutting him  as of 2 months away (that's 2 months notice!)Â and he would have to start paying his own way after that. The kid had the nerve to tell his dad "You can just cut me  Cold turkey! You need to ween me  gradually." I would have cut him Off right then! We (our society) has created this problem of "entitlement" and it is a hugh problem.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/669kc3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gblz</id></website><link>http://www.newser.com/story/comments/142378/10-of-adults-get-allowances.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-24T11:49:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:06:34+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkudhc</id><link>http://www.newser.com/story/comments/142378/10-of-adults-get-allowances.html#comment-476415255</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rbpcm</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
