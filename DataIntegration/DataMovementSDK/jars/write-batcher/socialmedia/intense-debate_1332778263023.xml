If the implication that Inge is coming north are true I would think the only questions would be Marte, Dirks, and Smyly. 

Thomas/Dirks is a toss-up- Thomas out of options could be a gamechanger- but I like Dirks better. Worth could also be at that Spot. All three can legitimately claim to have earned the Spot.

Marte: He's got a spring  of 0.00 and has exhibited no "command or control" issues. Plus I like saying "Luis Marte".

Smyly- coin toss. I really think there will be a trade/free agent signing before ST ends to Resolve the 5th starter issue.

I think this is as reasonable line-up at this point as any.
