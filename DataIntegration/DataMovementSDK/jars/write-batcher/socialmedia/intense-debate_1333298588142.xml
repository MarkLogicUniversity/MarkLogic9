NO sitting president should make any public comment about a pending criminal case. Any decent defense attorney would jump on that and argue the influence it may have had on prospective jurors.

If Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, the Black Panthers, etc. really cared about hate crimes they wouldn't onlyÂ be involved in and speak out against hate crimes against blacks, but against all hate crimes. I guess the Feb. case of the (white) boy in Kansas City who was attacked and set on fire by two as yet uncharged (black) suspects just didn't fit their agenda. And the Attorney General? Well you know he's not interested. Eric Holder has a policy firmly in place that his office will not pursue hate crime cases where the victims are white.

No doubt that this case stinks to high heaven, but what stinks even more is how it's being exploited for political purposes.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lhdzs</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rvdh</id></website><link>http://www.pressherald.com/news/nationworld/gunman-says-teen-threw-first-punch_2012-03-27.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T04:25:36+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-27T13:29:07+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/msdrql</id><link>http://www.pressherald.com/news/nationworld/gunman-says-teen-threw-first-punch_2012-03-27.html#comment-477399144</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cx4ew</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
