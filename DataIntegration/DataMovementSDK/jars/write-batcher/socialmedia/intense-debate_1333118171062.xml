The fans   for Giants players or when they show an ex Knick like Starks.  But the reception Ewing got...it was the loudest I've ever heard the Garden faithful .  It literally lasted about 3 or 4 minutes and went in like 4 different waves.  

It was funny too cause I felt like up until that point in the game, it was pretty close but then we took over big time from that moment on.  With the way our management did Ewing dirty at the end of his career and also how much Heat Ewing got sometimes from the media and fans while he was here, it was a really beautiful and moving thing to see the fans Cheer for him the way they did last night.  One of the most memorable moments I've experience at The Garden.  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zx7yo</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lilw</id></website><link>http://www.theknicksblog.com/2012/03/29/patrick-ewing-the-head-coach/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:16:13+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:29:10+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3f229</id><link>http://www.theknicksblog.com/2012/03/29/patrick-ewing-the-head-coach/#comment-479856986</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/co7tz</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
