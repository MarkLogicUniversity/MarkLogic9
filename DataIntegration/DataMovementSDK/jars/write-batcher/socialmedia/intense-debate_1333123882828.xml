When I was a kid, I was playing flag football and IÂ took someone's head intoÂ my nose and it Bled profusely. My teacher had me tilt my head forward and pinch my nose and by the time I went inside to the washroom, the Bleeding had stopped, 10 min or so at most. After I washed myself Off, no one even knew something had happened to me. It wasn't until later thet I found out that I had a fractured nose. As far as being prejudice, call me what you want but I believe what I hear on the 911 call. The problem I think is with you and your personal bias, perhaps because Zimmerman is at least part Jewish?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zr72l</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zsj8</id></website><link>http://www.torontosun.com/2012/03/29/shooter-of-florida-teen-appears-uninjured-in-video</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T12:49:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:37:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3s47p</id><link>http://www.torontosun.com/2012/03/29/shooter-of-florida-teen-appears-uninjured-in-video#comment-480207449</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gq3mr</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
