event like it on Earth. The music, the art, the people, the location-- all of
it comes together beautifully in the city of Indio every April for a phenomenon
that can only be understood once you experience it for yourself! I have been to
Coachella twice, and the organizers do an excellent job of making sure that
everyone has their own individual experience. If you ask two people about their
experience at Coachella, their answers will not be the same. That is because
Coachella is about discovering one's self while discovering art and music. From
both of the times I have been to Coachella, I have unraveled a sense of
excitement that activates each year as Coachella approaches. I tell people how
awesome Coachella is on a regular basis and how much of a great time it is to
go. Yet again, Goldenvoice has not disappointed this year, and I would love
nothing more than to get the chance to see the Acts they have managed to book.
Plus, I miss the people and the atmosphere of Coachella. I went without
Coachella last year, and I am Thirsting to go again. I also want to take my
sister, who has never been to California, and show her the experience of a
lifetime (and show her why I am such a Coachella fanatic)!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/669mkz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/owzb</id></website><link>http://hmcoachella.com/contests/comment</link><postedTime>2012-03-24T10:56:53+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:46:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkjfkt</id><link>http://hmcoachella.com/contests/comment#comment-476624573</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zyzar</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
