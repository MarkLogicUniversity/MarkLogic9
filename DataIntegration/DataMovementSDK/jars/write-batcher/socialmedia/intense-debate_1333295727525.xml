I was very interested in this until this sort of crap came out.

What if I wanted to use it to kill time on a long flight or when my internet goes down? And making me log intoÂ Origin to play it? They  people on there for Sneezing while playing. And let alone if I wanted to mod the game, that would make me some sort of hacker and they know all hackers are pirates, so the fact I modded the game proves I didn't pay for it even though I bought it through their service and am logged into it.

EA really went  the deep end when they signed exclusive rights to make sports games with every major sports franchise. They had to have signed a deal with the devil orÂ dealtÂ with such levels of sleaze there that they can't get it Off of themselves.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67qx9w</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/v6k</id></website><link>http://www.iheartchaos.com/post/20203884782</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:31:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T09:39:48+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwolrm</id><link>http://www.iheartchaos.com/post/20203884782#comment-481692499</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/87haa</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
