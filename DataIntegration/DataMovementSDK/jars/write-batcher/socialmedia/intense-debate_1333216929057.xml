Don't get me wrong, I like alot of things he says, he's just has a third party type air about him.

Â Â  TheÂ only reason to literally escape and run away from the leftist who'veÂ hijacked the Democratic Party is everything that's on display that you have to wade throughÂ daily. It's emerged to the point where this nation is unrecognizable. Now it's raisingÂ h*ll in the streets of our cities and god knowsÂ the Fever pitch it will Reach by election time.
