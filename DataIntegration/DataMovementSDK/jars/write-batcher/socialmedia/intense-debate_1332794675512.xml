And you're right about the pic I've heard it was from when he was 12 years old.Â  

When the media reported that a "white" man that looks 100% Hispanic shot a young black man I knew what they were trying to do.Â  Start a riot.

Unfortunately in the black community if you dare jump the "group think"... "group vote"... ship you're made a pariah.

I have a lot of black friends that are conservative and a lot of them are afraid to even say how they really feel and think.Â  This is truly fascistic.

I've often said for democrats to get 96% of any demographic's vote is frightening.Â  Saddam Hussein only used to get 98% of the vote and he used to kill people that voted against him!

I just keep praying blacks will wake up and smell the rose's Allen West has been sniffing... and get Off the democrats plantation just like he did.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l84wo</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/26/former-naacp-leader-accuses-sharpton-and-jackson-of-exploiting-trayvon-martin/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:18:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:33:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkobow</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/26/former-naacp-leader-accuses-sharpton-and-jackson-of-exploiting-trayvon-martin/#comment-476667250</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/avyib</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
