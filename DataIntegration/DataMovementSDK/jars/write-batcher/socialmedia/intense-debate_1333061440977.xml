You might get to your destination, but there's a great chance of getting blown up en route. 

My feelings about this whole mess are mixed. Perhaps a bit of history will clarify things. 

I was stationed in the Bay Area in the early 80s while serving in the USAF. I was in my early stages of exploring my Pagan path, and somehow came across one of Z's Dianic groups via a science fiction convention and Marion Zimmer Bradley's group. They were mixed in with MZB's people in the East Bay.Â I had been sexually assaulted, and they- and Z's "Holy Book Of Womens Mysteries" helped me to heal from that particular trauma. I also went through what I now call my Angry Militant Feminist stage. Mary Daly, Z Budapest and other feminist authors stoked that fire. 

My very brief Â interface with the Dianic group didÂ not end well, though. Once I got my head back and started feeling human again, I was told that my energy was 'too masculine' and that I was not doing myself any favors by serving in the military. I was urged to stop being a servant of 'the patriarchy', and urged to leave. When I chose to reenlist, I was asked to leave the group, and was shunned. I left for my next base shortly thereafter.

I bear no ill will towards them for this action. If this is an example of fundementalist feminist sepratist orthodoxy (and to my mind, it is), they're doing it right- even if it rubs some people wrong.Â Some women need separate spaces to heal, and some women choose to remain in that space.Â Â But with 30 years of hindsight behind me, it is also clear that some get stuck in the militant zealot (patriarchy victim)Â stage. I outgrew it. I am no longer a victim, or even a 'survivor'. Wisdom, experience, and genuine compassion have replaced my zealot militancy.Â I am a human being, soveriegn and complete. IÂ own my life- the good things and the bad.Â My righteous anger of that timeÂ served to Burn Off the crust of hate and fear, and instead of getting stuck there, I moved on. I won.

They have their holy places. I have the multiverse. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/yu5u19</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lpw5</id></website><link>http://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2012/02/should-there-be-freedom-of-religion-within-paganism/</link><postedTime>2012-02-20T15:40:19+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-02-20T16:21:24+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mlz60a</id><link>http://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2012/02/should-there-be-freedom-of-religion-within-paganism/#comment-444086029</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a6jli</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-02-20</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
