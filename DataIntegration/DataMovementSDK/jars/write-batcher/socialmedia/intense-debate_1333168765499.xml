every 10 years or so america needs a soulful diva who can sing her ass Off. the last one was beyonce. now she's 30 and has had a great 14 year run as a powerhouse talent. before her it was mariah. now she's pushing 40. it's time for a new girl to fill that Spot. rhianna has too weak of a voice and jennifer, as wonderful as she is, is beyonce's age. who better than exotic and immensely talented 16 year old jessica should a major record company take a chance on? 
with the right song and producer she has the potential to go all the way to the top of the charts.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l3m6i</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/vh3p</id></website><link>http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20312226_20582237_21138595,00.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T21:53:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T16:41:55+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/msstmo</id><link>http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20312226_20582237_21138595,00.html#comment-478526248</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
