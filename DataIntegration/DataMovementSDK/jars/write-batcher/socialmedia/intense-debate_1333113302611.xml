I  like to point out that if the woman had simply touched Jesus' garment and been healed without any further interaction with him, it would have been a huge tragedy. Every time she told her story, she would be reinforcing the idea that Jesus was like a magician, and people would think they could simply rip Off Jesus' clothes and get the magic. Jesus stopped to remind her that it was her faith, not his clothing, that put her in the powerful relationship that healed her. The miracles were all wonderful, but Jesus had to take care that people understood he wasn't a sideshow. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hlgkb</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tvmr</id></website><link>http://www.patheos.com/blogs/thinplaces/2012/03/faith-grief-and-growing-up/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T12:20:57+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:37:51+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3uin5</id><link>http://www.patheos.com/blogs/thinplaces/2012/03/faith-grief-and-growing-up/#comment-479803252</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/msbml</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
