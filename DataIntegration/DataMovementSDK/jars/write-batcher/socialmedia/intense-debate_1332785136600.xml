Tillman is still young, has options, and he's a righty. Conversely, Brian Matusz and Dana Eveland are lefties. That last starter Spot should be between those two. Of the two, Matusz has pitched better, but he's younger, has options left, and is coming Off a terrible year. Also, keep in mind that Duquette traded for Eveland and Eveland is out of options. I can see Eveland making the team as that 5th starter (not needed for a while), as he does long work out of the 'pen for a while. Matusz would be the first LHP called up if necessary and Tillman would be the first RHP called up if needed for a start. I think the plan all along was to have Matusz and Tillman start the year at Norfolk, regardless of how they played in the spring. We'll see.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ri9nz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/z6fr</id></website><link>http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2012/03/still-seeking-roster-clarity.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T12:00:03+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:31:40+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkfzjb</id><link>http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2012/03/still-seeking-roster-clarity.html#comment-476516866</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
