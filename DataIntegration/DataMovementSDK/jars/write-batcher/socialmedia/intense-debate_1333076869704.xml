When I read an article at breitbart.com yesterday revealing the misogynist attacks against Lt. Gov. Kleefisch I was absolutely appalled and disgusted to
the point of Nausea. The misogynistic John â€˜Slyâ€™ Sylvester (WTDY, Madison, WI)
who said on air that Kleefisch was performing â€˜fellatioâ€™ on talk show hosts and
rumored to have done a â€˜trainâ€™ (vulgar gang speak for gang rape) is the same
so-called â€œtolerantâ€&#157; leftist who said he would â€œpour Roundupâ€&#157; (weed killer) on
Andrew Breitbartâ€™s grave to be sure this â€œweedâ€&#157; wouldnâ€™t come back from the
dead. To glimpse what such a so-called â€œtolerantâ€&#157; leftist looks like and get an
idea of his horrific broadcast gleefully celebrating Breitbartâ€™s death, you can
find it at the youtube link. Warning, it starts  as a tongue-in-cheek
â€˜memorialâ€™ and then launches into a stomach-churning death fest. Seems the
so-called â€œtolerantâ€&#157; leftists believe that only some women deserve apologies
for sexist/misogynistic remarks about them, and clearly, Lt. Gov. Kleefisch
isnâ€™t among those â€œsomeâ€&#157; women. Also seems the so-called â€œtolerantâ€&#157; leftists
believe only some people (and their families/loved ones) deserve to be treated
with respect during a time of tragic death, and clearly, Andrew Breitbart isnâ€™t
among those â€œsomeâ€&#157; people. Also seems the so-called â€œtolerantâ€&#157; leftists believe
only some people deserve health care for terminal conditions, and clearly,
former VP Dick Cheney isnâ€™t among those â€œsomeâ€&#157; people. Apparently those â€œsomeâ€&#157;
people would be those who lockstep salute, follow/agree with the leftistsâ€™
radical viewpoints and agenda. So-called â€œtolerantâ€&#157; leftist media hacks such as
â€˜Slyâ€™ Sylvester arenâ€™t, in actual point of fact, â€œtolerant.â€&#157; IMO, theyâ€™re
anti-human, as the youtube video clearly shows. In fact, one wonders whether
they are actually even human, or leftist automotons, so imbued and jaded by the
radical leftist propaganda and venom in which theyâ€™ve been stewed that they
perhaps no longer have a human heart, intellect or soul. â€˜Slyâ€™ is indicative of
what Gov.  Walker and Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch have been battling in
Wisconsin along with bused-in union goons, MoveOn.org astroturfers, Obamacrats,
et al, wreaking chaos in their state. Meanwhile, Walker and Kleefisch have been
saving the stateâ€™s economy and saving workersâ€™ jobs. Their reward so far from
the so-called â€œtolerantâ€&#157; leftists? An undeserved recall election and hacks such
as â€˜Slyâ€™ allowed to remain on the airwaves despite their hate speech. The upside is
that in such evil attacks the so-called â€œtolerantâ€&#157; leftists reveal themselves
for the enemies of humanity that they are. â€˜Slyâ€™ needs to be taken Off the air for spewing his woman-hating, humanity-hating filth.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zc9go</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7e99</id></website><link>http://conservatives4palin.com/2012/03/open-thread-259.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:25:06+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:12:40+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3u6o2</id><link>http://conservatives4palin.com/2012/03/open-thread-259.html#comment-479777616</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/eupoy</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
