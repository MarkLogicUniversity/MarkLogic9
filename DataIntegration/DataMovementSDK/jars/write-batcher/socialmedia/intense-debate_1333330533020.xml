That and changing up your workout Always helps.  I get bored easily myself so I have to change up my goals often to keep me motivated.  Plus my attention span is really short! Thumbing through fitness magazines is also motivating for me.  I get new ideas and inspiration from them to change it up or start it up!  And lastly, the last few pounds and inches are definitely the hardest to shave, but you will get there - no doubt!  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/674dx0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/btut</id></website><link>http://www.baxtronlife.com/2012/03/meltdown-v13.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:06:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T15:22:10+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw3c5o</id><link>http://www.baxtronlife.com/2012/03/meltdown-v13.html#comment-481913884</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
