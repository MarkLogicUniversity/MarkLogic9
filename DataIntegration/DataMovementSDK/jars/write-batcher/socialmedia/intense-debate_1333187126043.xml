He got out and harrassed that kid, when point blank told NOT TO.Â  The kid got scared and defended himself.Â  He had no weapon.Â  Zimmerman was bradishing a weapon.Â  I'd be scared too. If Trayvon punched him (with no injuries to his hands??), then Zimmerman panicked, was a first class wimp, and shot the kid in Cold blood.Â  He's not a man, nor did he "defend himself".Â  He harrassed the kid, got his butt kicked for threatening him, and thought killing the kid would solve his problem... I'm sure Glad I'm not Zimmerman. Even if he gets away with this, he will live in fear for years.Â  His life is over...Maybe next time he'll think about being all big and bad and macho for no reason...</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z3b9t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:25:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:06:48+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwlbnj</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-480959307</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/1bnu</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
