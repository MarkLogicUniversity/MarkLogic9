This was a common technique used in the 00s. Many of which were conspiring with housing flippers to drive the price up, take the commissions and let the borrows fail. The failure was that GWB did nothing about the indicators that many economists were warning of. This problem was going on for a large part of his presidency. But he did nothing. Why? His business cronies where making bank Off of middle america. Then turning around selling the debt, than betting on it to fail. I'm quite sure, these issues were not in Clinton's bill. This was the manipulation of a well intended bill, aimed at providing a way for middle america to buy a home. Who's to blame, the guy who stacked the wood? Or the one who set it on fire, and let it Burn?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/675xrl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rvx5</id></website><link>http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/30/markets/stocks/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:41:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T00:20:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwx5iy</id><link>http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/30/markets/stocks/#comment-481356225</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lqkbl</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
