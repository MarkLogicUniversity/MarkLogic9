We've seen glimpses and tours of Congressional offices and homes. How impressive, how opulent!!Â  There's the first cut. All members have the same GI offices. Regular wood desks to black and white tile floors. This is a work place. Then we cut Off their per deim for housing. Put them all in the same apt complex, no rent, with one to three B/Rs the only difference. They can use their own furnishings. More saved!!! The savings are starting to mount up here folks. No limos, buses would leave from the complex on the half hour to work and back. No bottled water. Give them all a Britta filter system. More saved....wheee!!! Now the capper, fine them when they miss a session. No work, No pay!!!!!Â  We make it far too comfortable for our leaders. Cut the A/CÂ  or Heat when they waste time. In the summer pitch big tents outside and they can work there. Nothing motivates like misery. They will get the business done quickly when they share the misery.Â  BAAAHHAHAHAAA Ahahahahaaaaa............</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67v2i9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnei</id></website><link>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/30/3139837/the-buzz.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T22:48:53+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T16:56:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwwp7y</id><link>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/30/3139837/the-buzz.html#comment-481994613</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cmgqh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
