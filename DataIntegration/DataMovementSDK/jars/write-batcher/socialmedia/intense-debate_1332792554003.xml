It's not that I think you don't already know this stuff, it's just that I'd hate for anything to happen to you in the Off chance that you didn't know it.  
Best wishes. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rc55e</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dypr</id></website><link>http://www.sixbillionsecrets.com/view/Self-esteem/1597542</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T02:00:44+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:01:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mko24e</id><link>http://www.sixbillionsecrets.com/view/Self-esteem/1597542#comment-476638350</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gzpmf</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
