I'm not sure who the advocate is.........more than just an owner.......a marketeer maybe?


Pardon my being suspicious but if this car is so great.......why is there such difficultyÂ selling them? The Spot this morning made it soundÂ like the greatest thing since  bread.........but I have confidence in the American consumer and I don't see people queueing up to buy these things like they were the latest Ipad or athletic shoe! ItÂ bothers me that Obama, with his reputation, wants to up the purchaserÂ tax credit on this thing to $10,000 and that it still has a price around $40,000. With the price of gas, it would seem like the car would attractÂ buyers like bees to honey!

No........there's more to this than what I heard this morning!!!
