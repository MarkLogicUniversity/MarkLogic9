REALLY?

Federal make-work programs are the economic equivalent of drinking your own urine to fend of Thirst. You get temporary relief then lasting death. It doesn't work. You aren't creating wealth. Any wages paid these 15 million workers would be nearly instantly be offset by inflation and devaluation of the dollar.

Seriously, this is econ 101 stuff. You can't just create a money recycling program and call it a job. Nothing is created. The economy doesn't expand. The reduction of available market liquidity results in the net value of goods and services being reduced to represent the cash removed from the marketplace. No one ultimately is any better Off.

It's economic suicide.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/mlmml6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/10/14/rep-jesse-jackson-calls-on-government-to-hire-all-unemployed-americans-for/</link><postedTime>2011-10-15T00:52:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-10-15T23:06:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/gqknen</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/10/14/rep-jesse-jackson-calls-on-government-to-hire-all-unemployed-americans-for/#comment-335716076</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c2i66</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-10-15</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
