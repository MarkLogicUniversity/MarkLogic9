He began by asking foolish question if it was 4 or 3 allegation that was levied against him.

You don't need to tell anybody that this MAN IS A BIG TIME CORRUPT FELLOW MEMBER OF HOUSE OF REP. Pschologically, it was obvious that this man was not expecting The DG to be bold to come out with those issues but thank she did.

They are all bird of same feather, they will want to cover him up. what do we expect if the Senators can do same about their own, a lawmaker representing Borno South Senatorial District, Mohammed Ali Ndume.

All we need is a radical revolution in this nation NIGERIA
