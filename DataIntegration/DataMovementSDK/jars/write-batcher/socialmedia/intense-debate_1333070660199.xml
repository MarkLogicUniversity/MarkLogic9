I disagree that Ben Browder was ever dull; I was Always very engaged by his performance, and he had ample opportunity to play just about every possible beat on the emotional spectrum. 

And while I'm generally not a fan of bodily-function humor, it worked for this show because it helped emphasize the reality of the setting and how much of life is spectacularly gross. You're going to deal with additional ickiness in alien settings, so get ready for some giant space monster Vomit.

I also found the show's gender politics to be interesting. John is the strong, competent, yet vulnerable and more emotionally open character, while Aeryn is tough and less openly emotional but still capable of deep love and loyalty. The show as a whole plays a lot with many shades of sexuality and gender stuff without being exploitative.

More than any other show, this one is what it looks like to walk around in my brain.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/d8b0bx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/farscape-the-complete-series,65812/</link><postedTime>2011-11-30T06:03:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-11-30T19:43:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/emwl70</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/farscape-the-complete-series,65812/#comment-376156799</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/duk4n</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-11-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
