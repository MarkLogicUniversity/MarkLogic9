If all 5 players are in the same mind set, then there is  a chance to win games and not the other way around. The big guys should Always be aggressively going to drive to the basket or dunk it and the point guard, shooting guard, small forward or power forward should help their center score points and it becomes a inside-outside game were it is harder to play man to man or zone.
As proven by Durant mainly that night against the Heat, if he assist the center or power forward to win games, then Durant is becoming a mature player. What if he scores 50 points and the team still looses, then all his points become meaningless and the team falls behind the team standing and might miss the play-offs!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r1ycj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gfhw</id></website><link>http://newsok.com/article/3660911</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T04:59:24+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:50:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkowgw</id><link>http://newsok.com/article/3660911#comment-476681974</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lfjxy</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
