Your suggestion is not only Spot on, but is a description of what health insurance was meant for initially and what, I believe, insurance will become.Â  Health insurance is meant for catastrophic events.Â  As we see a shift to higher deductible plans we will see consumer increasingly responsible for their own insurance costs.Â  That drives better behavior such as watching our own health and shopping for the best value for the medical care we receive.Â  It also discourages wasteful use of medical resources: running Off to the doctor or pharmacy every time you have a sniffle.Â  I had someone phrase the question well: when was the last time you washed a rental car?Â  Consumers will use and OVER-use insurance when they feel that they are not paying for it.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ht598</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6rx1</id></website><link>http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/53808876-68/care-court-health-justices.html.csp</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T16:04:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:10:36+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m34fdd</id><link>http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/53808876-68/care-court-health-justices.html.csp#comment-479563064</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c83s2</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
