Bank robberies, violent shootings caught on tape, car jackings, and drive-by shootings are carried out by predators wearing black hoodies. Understandably, when law abiding citizens (of all colors)Â continually see the criminalsÂ uniform of choiceÂ &amp; wanting to conceal their identity, it's almost  the dark/blackÂ "hoodie". Not the hoodie worn to aÂ football game on a ColdÂ friday night or a pink Aeropostile type pull over. The oversize black hoodieÂ sybmolizes intemidation and danger to law abiding citizens. If young people in todays societyÂ wantÂ to be treated with respect and dignity, learn to EARN respect and dignity with good behavior and marketable job/career skills. Pull up your pants, wear cloths that fit, and keep the hoods Off your faces in 85 degree weather! Then watch the world change for the better........Â Â Â Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hwgob</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dndz</id></website><link>http://www.macon.com/2012/03/28/1966412/second-macon-vigil-held-for-martin.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T00:27:53+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:27:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3t89g</id><link>http://www.macon.com/2012/03/28/1966412/second-macon-vigil-held-for-martin.html#comment-479487245</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8ou6q</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
