Unfortunately this has lead to some Burned bridges which is not what I like to do&amp;nbsp;at all but even when I tried to find resolutions that would work for both sides these people turned out to be even more impossible then I imagined.  
One guy literally would not let me quit. I offered 3 weeks notice and to come in even after that&amp;nbsp;to train my replacement. He told me it was unacceptable, I&amp;nbsp;HAD to stay since he was paying me, if I went thru with quitting he would not pay me anymore.&amp;nbsp;When that didn&amp;#039;t work he tried to&amp;nbsp;slam me professionally saying me qutting meant I didn&amp;#039;t stand behind my work which must means it&amp;#039;s not good.&amp;nbsp;Once I realized there was no working with him, I just&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#039;t show up anymore. Thankfully I only lost out on&amp;nbsp;3 days pay (because for sure he didn&amp;#039;t pay me) but I am&amp;nbsp;much happier at a new position.&amp;nbsp; </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:324020:128007930</id><idPostId>128007930</idPostId><idBlogId>324020</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:324020</id><idBlogId>324020</idBlogId><link>http://www.sooverdebt.com</link><displayName>So Over Debt</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.sooverdebt.com/why-i-just-turned-down-a-part-time-job/</link><displayName>Why I Just Turned Down a Part-Time Job</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-07T10:49:00.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:324020:128007930:329089058</id><link>http://www.sooverdebt.com/why-i-just-turned-down-a-part-time-job/#IDComment329089058</link><postedTime>2012-03-07T10:49:00.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Why I Just Turned Down a Part-Time Job by Jesort415</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://talesofarealjerseyhousewife.blogspot.com/</link><idEmailMd5>25043ee20fb037fc068d0d8b4c616c4b</idEmailMd5><displayName>Jesort415</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://talesofarealjerseyhousewife.blogspot.com/"&gt;Jesort415&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://www.sooverdebt.com/why-i-just-turned-down-a-part-time-job/"&gt;Why I Just Turned Down a Part-Time Job&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-07</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
