Hillary is popular because she's serving as SOS, a position that, by law, forbids her from being involved in politics. That'll change the minute she gets back into politics."Â 

It will change, but she's currently up aroundÂ 70%.Â  Even if it came down to 60%, she would remain a strong electoral asset.

 "2. Biden is not as high-profile or as well-known as Hillary but that is no independent data that suggests he's unpopular."Â
