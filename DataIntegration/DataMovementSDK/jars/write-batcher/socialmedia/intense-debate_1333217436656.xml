I miss the structure of the GB titles, which were excellent at making puzzles out of the places and enemies themselves so that you had to travel about doing all sorts of stuff to Reach a goal. I don't really enjoy the pattern of manipulating one thing, moving forward, solving a riddle, moving on, playing Tic-tac-toe, moving forward... The puzzle aspect shouldn't be divorced from the adventuring.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/676ut7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/fw87</id></website><link>http://www.zeldadungeon.net/2012/03/action-puzzle-solving-navigation-finding-a-balance-in-3d/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:22:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:49:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwt7yq</id><link>http://www.zeldadungeon.net/2012/03/action-puzzle-solving-navigation-finding-a-balance-in-3d/#comment-481183111</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h3yd1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
