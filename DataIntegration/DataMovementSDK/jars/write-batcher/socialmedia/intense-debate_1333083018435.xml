Cuts to the scalp Bleed profusely do to the large number of capillaries running through the skin, and had the "cut" been as large as it appears to be in that video, then paramedics would have taken him to the emergency room to get stictches.Â  There's no way that a gash that large to the back of the skull would, not leave the backÂ of Zimmerman's neck dried with bloodÂ or would itÂ be left unattended by EMT, even if Zimmerman said he was fine, he would have lost a good bit of blood by the time he Reached the police station.Â  It looks more like a shadow from wrinkles in his skin.Â  Look at the two images and you'll notice that even the shadow of the motorcycle shows up darker, especially along the edges, in the second image.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6za97r</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/police-surveillance-video-of-zimmerman-may-show-head-injury/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T04:19:40+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:02:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31zil</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/police-surveillance-video-of-zimmerman-may-show-head-injury/#comment-479829540</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6uwua</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
