Wolf is warping belt to belt and cane is on or near a station. Obvious bait is obvious.
I land 100km  the wolf and mwd around a bit, my normal overview has keep at 1000km, standard is 1000m ... I click keep at range and start Burning into scram range without even locking him.
Thankfully I Resolve lock as he overshoots me and web goes on at 7km, range is kept and a few volleys puts him down, I then start messing with the overview buttons and the cane lands at 15km ... forgot about that one. I put range easily and warp to station. pop the wreck as I run away, no loot for anyone if I cant have it. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ysmpk</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/bhjw</id></website><link>http://tuskers.killmail.org/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=12821820</link><postedTime>2012-03-23T01:22:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T01:27:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi68d3</id><link>http://tuskers.killmail.org/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=12821820#comment-474121185</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rchbf</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-23</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
