post.Â  ROM developers are independents
who do all of their own development and testing (limited testing I might add).Â  This is why they are able to have
such quick turnarounds.Â  Itâ€™s also why a lot of ROMâ€™s have so many bugs and limited functionality.Â  It seems almost a given everytime I hear about a new ROM to see an additional sentence stating something like â€œeverything
works except the camera, gps and blah blah blahâ€&#157;.



However things are much more complicated when it comes to working with multiple people across multiple corporations.Â  There are numerous factors, technical and
non-technical that come into play.Â  Corporations do not have unlimited resources.Â  There are usually 2 to 3 various projects being worked on by a team of developers and
each marketing manager spearheading that specific project  wants their project done first!Â Â 

Reminds of a sign I saw hanging at my mechanics shop.Â  It said - â€œDonâ€™t ask me to do a rush job on your car ahead of the rush job Iâ€™m already working on and the rush job asked for by the guy ahead of you.â€&#157; Â Well hire more developers I hear you say. Â That will fix the problem. Â No actually it will more than likely introduce more bugs and problems into the process (read Code Complete). Â Plus developers cost money and that cost will only get passed on to you the customer!



Not only that you have to account for the human factor
also.Â  What is that you ask?Â  Oh well Johnny is working on the GPS bug which he estimates to take about 80 hours of work.Â  But Johnny has a dentist apt scheduled on
Tuesday so heâ€™ll be leaving early around 2:00.Â  Also he is scheduled to take a 1 week vacation the following week.Â  And oops seems like Johnny caught the bug Flu that's been going around and takes 2 sick days.

And when Johnny is at work he also has to do stupid
stuff like staff meetings, mandatory corporate training on harassment and maintaining company confidentiality.Â  He has to fill out his stupid self-evaluation form for his annual review.Â  And donâ€™t forget the average 2 hours of time most of us spend lollygagging on the internet while at work (like writing comments on Phandroid â€“ guilty as charged LOL).



And thatâ€™s just Johnny.Â Your average project team probably has about 15 to 20 different members.Â  Now multiply that by 3 or 4 different companies who are all involved in bringing a product to market.Â  Not to mention Scope creep and newly found bugs that may be showstoppers.Â Â 

And believe me there are several other things that Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m forgetting to mention.Â Â  But all it boils down to is that it takes time.Â  And self-absorbed fanboys who have no idea of how the real world works will never understand or appreciate all that goes into releasing a product.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zm4mw</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7d1z</id></website><link>http://phandroid.com/2012/03/29/googles-software-engineer-drops-some-truth-bombs-talks-about-8-month-waiting-period-before-updates-reach-our-hands/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T09:10:05+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:55:10+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3xnrn</id><link>http://phandroid.com/2012/03/29/googles-software-engineer-drops-some-truth-bombs-talks-about-8-month-waiting-period-before-updates-reach-our-hands/#comment-479696672</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/yk8dd</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
