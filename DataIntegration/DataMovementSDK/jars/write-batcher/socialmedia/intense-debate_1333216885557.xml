Abreu for Inge.  For the Angels good due to Inge's versatility - the wild card being an unofficial extra catcher for extra-inning games where a pinch hitter could replace the C Spot in a critical at bat time.

Abreu is still a good OBP guy, can play some OF, and on the Tigers might DH more until Victor Martinez comes back.

Abreu's 9 million vs Inge's 5.5 million would probably mean the Angels eating some salary - or perhaps a deal could be expanded.

A big problem with a deal between these two teams would be that both are playoff caliber - hence even more dicey to deal with than non-p-caliber teams in one's own division.  But being a "spare parts" deal, maybe this could get done.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zpdg7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27748424%26vkey=news_ana%26c_id=ana</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:30:37+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:22:07+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwvklt</id><link>http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27748424%26vkey=news_ana%26c_id=ana#comment-481157297</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ybr9s</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
