This also eliminates many of the Headaches associated with countries who demand access to BBM for security or political reasons: if the mass market "funberries" are readily hackable by governments, they can simply Ban the secure types from sale in their territories rather than demanding the key to RIM's local servers.  I have no doubt that half the reason despotic regimes require this is because it lets them read private messages coming &lt;b&gt;into&lt;/b&gt; their nations as well as those sent by citizens.  Of course, the overriding concern in the short term is developer interest.  If the Android player for Blackberry works out well, there's no reason that RIM could not only survive but actually prosper as a trinity of interdependent divisions.  They should already be moving beyond an emulator and working on a true Android compatibility layer for QNX.  The native environment underneath could be the domain of hardened BB apps.

Hines is right: you can't be all things to all people, at least not with a single product.  However, the consumer line can be a subset of the professional series.  It &lt;b&gt;could&lt;/b&gt; work, and it would definitely be a huge distinction for a company who's relied on a nice keyboard and trackpad for a bit too long.  Oh, and a pet peeve that other QWERTY users might understand: BBs need an ALT key on both sides, just like the shift key is.  It would make typing so much nicer.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zoqw1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/nw4s</id></website><link>http://betanews.com/2012/03/29/lifelines-for-a-dying-blackberry-integrating-re-branding-licensing/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:50:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:00:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3siwz</id><link>http://betanews.com/2012/03/29/lifelines-for-a-dying-blackberry-integrating-re-branding-licensing/#comment-480223670</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8zmz9</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
