ultimate objective of HSUS is to separate us entirely from animals.Â  No 
meat, milk or eggs, no hunting or fishing, no fur or leather, and no 
pets."

Why?Â  Because I don't subscribe to insane conspiracy theories.Â  

If you think HSUS -- which has been among the most moderate voices in animal welfare -- is actually an abolitionist organization, you have no idea what the issues are, or who your opponents are.

It Always makes me laugh when some nutbar comes crawling out of the woodwork to declare that HSUS wants to eliminate all pets, despite the fact that HSUS funds the Shelter Pet Project, encourages pet adoptions and pet-friendly policies in workplaces and apartments, offers advice on finding and caring for pets, etc., etc.Â  

And they never seem to have an explanation for the huge number of HSUS employees who have pets of their own, and are fiercely devoted to them.Â  Do you honestly believe these people would support and work for an organization that wanted to take their pets away?

And people like "njcatlover" expect to be taken seriously after Vomiting up paranoid lunacy like that...</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6dw2kr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/b7s3</id></website><link>http://www.kearneyhub.com/news/opinion/article_d98a39ee-7372-11e1-8fb1-0019bb2963f4.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T18:09:02+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:05:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi8m0n</id><link>http://www.kearneyhub.com/news/opinion/article_d98a39ee-7372-11e1-8fb1-0019bb2963f4.html#comment-473755376</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/883v4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
