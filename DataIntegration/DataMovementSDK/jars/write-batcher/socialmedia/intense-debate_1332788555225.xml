You're right about Jonas crying over Colton's injury.Â  He had a soft Spot for Colton.Â  But his tears were inspired by Colton's removal from the game, not a personality change.Â  Jonas' Jury vote would entirely Depend on who was sitting next to Colton.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rnrgc</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/cq4t</id></website><link>http://robhasawebsite.com/christina-cha-survivor-one-world-turnaround.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T23:43:12+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:56:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk9ixv</id><link>http://robhasawebsite.com/christina-cha-survivor-one-world-turnaround.html#comment-476584036</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ayb4g</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
