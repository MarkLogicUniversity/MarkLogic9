Imagine death row UK? 
What about the endless appeals to courts asking for stays of execution, and the lawyers fees? 
What about trying to keep a lid on the massive media circus that would inevitably surround executions?
The cost of the effort to keep the identities of people involved in executions Secret?
It just goes on and on.Â  We might bring in a law where criminals like Brady and Sutcliffe could choose to be executed if they want to. But even that would be fraught with difficulty. 
I'm a conservative in favour of tougher punishments for crimes that ruin lives, but I'm dead against capital punishment.
In a way life imprisonment is a harsher penalty. All the years of incarceration, hoping against hope for some sort of release turns people into grease Spots. They get utterly crushed and die young anyway. Look at Hindley.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rsnix</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xps8</id></website><link>http://www7.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2012/03/26/eating-in-at-number-10-marfs-take/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T13:35:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:15:51+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk1dd0</id><link>http://www7.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2012/03/26/eating-in-at-number-10-marfs-take/#comment-476461763</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6ct7f</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
