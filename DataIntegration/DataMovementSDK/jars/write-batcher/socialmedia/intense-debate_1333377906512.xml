Whose? The point is to grow the freedom that capitalism created for owners so that owners can't restrict the freedom of everyone else. This has Always been the big blind Spot of capitalism. Its consciousness is centered in the minds of the biggest owners. Then they wonder why everyone else is miserable and grumbling. Then it becomes necessary to crack down on workers trying to organize on their on behalf. It becomes necessary to spend some excess profits launching constant and massive propaganda campaigns against unions. Once the owners dominate government, and make government do bad things to us, it is necessary to demonize government to eliminate any hope that people have of using their own government to defend themselves from the owners.

Whose freedom and on whose terms? Do you not see that the corporate elites are very little different from Communist Party oligarchies? You're looking in the mirror and hating your own ideology, unaware.Â 

Look instead at the growing movement toward worker-owned cooperatives. Democracy from the bottom up. People are happier when they enjoy creative control over their own work. See, for ex. Participatory Economics.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vt0x6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/04/01/ayers-get-up-every-morning-thinking-today-im-gonna-end-capitalism/</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T13:11:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T10:31:05+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0pcm1</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/04/01/ayers-get-up-every-morning-thinking-today-im-gonna-end-capitalism/#comment-483406980</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lmr1j</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
