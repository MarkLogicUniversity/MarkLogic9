Meanwhile,  I wonder how much methane is being released?   Because methane is 20 times the greenhouse gas that CO2 is.  NYC has just gone through "the winter that wasn't".  Trees appear to be taking longer to bloom,  probably because the high winter temps means they didn't get such a good winters sleep.  They "wake up" and begin Burning the fuel they saved to fuel their spring bloom.  If a errant freeze were to knock the buds Off,  we'll probably have a bumper crop of dead trees.  

Someone needs to start tallying these things PDQ.
