My 9 yr. old daughter had a sleep study which indicated a strong  tendency for narcolepsy, and just had bloodwork done to test for a genetic marker for narcolepsy which turned out to be POSITIVE.  After searching for an answer for her Tiredness for almost 3 years, I am overcome with Joy to be able to put a name to this.  I have been told that this is a lifetime illness, but feel positive that we will deal with this one day at a time.  Hope research continues so that narcoleptics can live as normal a life as possible in the future.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ew67mm</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/bmgf</id></website><link>http://www.aboutnarcolepsy.org/87/narcolepsy-in-children/</link><postedTime>2011-09-20T15:29:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-12T16:49:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mu3j69</id><link>http://www.aboutnarcolepsy.org/87/narcolepsy-in-children/#comment-463469426</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-09-20</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
