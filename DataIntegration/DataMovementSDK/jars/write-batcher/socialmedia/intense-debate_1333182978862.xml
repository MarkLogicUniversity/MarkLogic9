My wife is an ER Nurse in a major city and it is without a doubt that the Medicaid-welfare patients continually clog the ER with minor things like Colds that cost a fortune to be treated in an ER situation instead of with a GP or at an urgent care clinic. Also, the medicaid-welfare patients are consistantly rude &amp; belligerant with doctors &amp; nurses hollering at them and demanding to be catered to, not in matters of healthcare, but about being allowed to leave the ER to smoke or demanding that the nurses  like waitresses and bring them food and drink. With surprising regularity, their belligerance turns to violence and they often attack the very doctors &amp; nurses who are there to care for them. One of my wife's collegaues is on extended leave after being kicked in the face by a medicaid patient when the nurse refused to bring the patient a Coke, because the patient was to have nothing by mouth. This will only get worse &amp; worse under ObamaCare.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67cz5e</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/03/30/what-doctor-knows-about-obamacare/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:43:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:36:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwr02q</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/03/30/what-doctor-knows-about-obamacare/#comment-480928771</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c90x5</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
