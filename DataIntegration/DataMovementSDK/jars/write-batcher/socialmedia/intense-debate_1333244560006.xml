I just wanted to echo what others have said, that my son went through this too. Unfortunately my pediatrician was not very helpful. He finally refferred us to a pediatric gastrointerologist I think just to shut me up. But we did finally get some answers. My son was having accidents and was so upset about it I just knew it had to be beyond his control. Turns out he was constipated. The way I understood it is that he was so constipated that his body found a way for his poop to "sneak around" the Constipation because it had nowhere else to go. But he truly had no control over it. Miralax worked wonders. My advice would be ti be persistant with your pediatrician. Hope you can get some answers!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67dfgx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7fwk</id></website><link>http://mwopblog.com/2012/03/weekend-open-road/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:50:46+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:13:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwn85j</id><link>http://mwopblog.com/2012/03/weekend-open-road/#comment-481306059</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hga3v</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
