it is  warmongers i.e. 'speculators'. causing high oil prices and it is post peak oil and it is after gulf is destroyed by big oil and northÂ sea is now destroyed etc....

so times change...exceptÂ it is getting worse and worse because of big oil. we shouldÂ find out how many more species are extinct because of big oil pollution directly and why all dolphins in gulf have cancer due to big oil and how many species are indirectly extinct due to massive Heat waves droughts floods etc due to fossil fuel pollution..these are all externalities. big oilÂ HAS to startÂ paying the TRUE cost of their damages theyÂ are causing or there can be no recovery..itÂ will nonstop climate catastrophes plus world warÂ with iran. itÂ will be aboutÂ as successful as any recent war for oil. which is NOT AT ALL SUCCESSFUL and we will be worse Off..which is end goal of GOP.Â  (and to defeat obama). nowhere ever does GOP ever once state an actual concrete policy objective of improving americans' future. it isn't their goal!!!!wake up!!!!!Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/y3pnxm</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/amtr</id></website><link>http://www.treehugger.com/fossil-fuels/fox-news-explains-why-presidents-cant-control-gas-prices-2008-video.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-06T23:01:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T18:50:31+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m02s06</id><link>http://www.treehugger.com/fossil-fuels/fox-news-explains-why-presidents-cant-control-gas-prices-2008-video.html#comment-482092534</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rfe4y</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-06</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
