Bottom line.  Linux is for Linux users.  Anyone can be a Linux user.  You just need to download and install a free copy.  You don't even need to install it.  You can try it by running it Off of the CD first.  Still waiting for that Windows LiveCD.  

I'm told Mepis is good for the first time user.

Don't let a mag make your OS decisions for you.  Try what you want and see what works best for you.  For some people Evolution will work just as well as Outlook.  Some people don't have a smart phone.  My phone has bluetooth and that works well enough with my Linux computer.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r38x7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zjs9</id></website><link>http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225544/Why_Linux_will_never_be_factor_on_the_desktop</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T13:59:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:35:19+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3kn5f</id><link>http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225544/Why_Linux_will_never_be_factor_on_the_desktop#comment-480162985</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zz1om</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
