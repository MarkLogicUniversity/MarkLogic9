 away under a list of medications in the report on   Obama&amp;rsquo;s recent physical exam is this intriguing notation:  
&amp;ldquo;Jet lag/time zone management, direct physician prescribed program, occasional medication use.&amp;rdquo; .......................................... 
 
Obama&amp;rsquo;s doctor, Navy Capt. Jeffrey Kuhlman, didn&amp;rsquo;t say what drug the president might be taking to fight the mind-numbing effects of crossing too many time zones. But sleep doctors we consulted say one possibility is Provigil, a stimulant that is regularly prescribed to help people fend  excessive sleepiness. 
 
&lt;b&gt;Fans claim you get all the benefits of a triple shot of espresso without the jitters or Anxiety that can accompany a massive hit of caffeine.&lt;/b&gt; 
............................................................................................................. 
&amp;ldquo;If they&amp;rsquo;re going to give him something to wake him up, Provigil is the way to go,&amp;rdquo; says Dr. Lisa Shives, medical director of Northshore Sleep Medicine in Evanston, Illinois. 
*************************************************************************************** 
 
While the White House won&amp;#039;t say what the president is actually taking, Provigil (also known by its generic name modafinil) is an intriguing possibility.  
 
&lt;u&gt;The drug has acquired an almost mythic status in recent years as a pill that makes it possible for the user to bypass the all-too-human need for sleep and work 24 or even 36 hours at a stretch. &lt;/u&gt; 
 
Manufactured by Cephalon, it&amp;rsquo;s in a class of medications called &amp;ldquo;wakefulness promoting agents.&amp;rdquo;  
 
  
 It&amp;rsquo;s reported to be increasingly popular among sleep-deprived cohorts like long-distance truckers, 
 fighter pilots,  
and students pulling all-nighters&amp;mdash; 
 
......................... and brought in $1 billion for Cephalon in 2008. 
 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;One little hitch:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
 It&amp;rsquo;s not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this purpose.  
 
The FDA says modafinil can only be marketed as a treatment for 3 things:  
 
narcolepsy,  
 
shift-work sleep disorder  
 
and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients who have been treated for obstructive sleep apnea.  
 
Using the drug to keep patients awake after a long trip would be considered &amp;ldquo;-label,&amp;rdquo; although it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly legal and very common, says Shives.  
 
And that Off-label status could soon change. The FDA is reviewing Cephalon&amp;rsquo;s application to market a drug called Nuvigil, which is similar to Provigil, as a jet-lag remedy.
