That's why we get so sweaty in bed doing that which makes us sweaty. If we didn't, we would die from Heat stroke. Also, we produce more than just Heat. I believe Einstein was referring to the electrical impulses which help make up our thoughts. Does all the electricity get released as Heat? Has this ever been accurately measured? Don't forget that most of the Heat in the human body requires chemicals for its production in addition to electricity, because the total voltage of the human bioelectrical system wouldn't be enough to run a Sony Walkman.

See this is one of the reasons I've decided to be okay with not knowing whether or not there is an afterlife. At least I'm not staying awake until four in the morning having arguments like this in my head. :D</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l9gsz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zrso</id></website><link>http://www.ghosttheory.com/?p=14296</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T16:30:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:24:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31sfn</id><link>http://www.ghosttheory.com/?p=14296#comment-479852696</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
