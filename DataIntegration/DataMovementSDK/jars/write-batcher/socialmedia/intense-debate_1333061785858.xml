Come on he wouldn't say his piece in a room of people. Trained2supportliars can only use his mothers computer, with  up and the boughs of his trained eye deep in the depth of ma ma's basement to express his lonely views. Once I noticed he posted a comment that ended with a pro-noun. Now he is trained to Spot this kind of skullduggery so I came up with the conclusion that his puppy pulled, unintentionally, his computers electric plug. He was offline for a couple of days before mother noticed it unplugged. To cover up this incident he blamed it on Miss Rice. Its like Comfort food for them. ..... and Dave insane with moron is little to kind for the trained mind..... the colour is blue sir.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zclg5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/second-trayvon-martin-twitter-feed-identified/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:00:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:58:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3qqfn</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/second-trayvon-martin-twitter-feed-identified/#comment-479602568</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zze56</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
