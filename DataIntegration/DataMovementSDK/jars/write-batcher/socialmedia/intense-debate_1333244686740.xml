The world of promotions is a highly nuanced one where if you over offer, the take up kills you. Under offer and no one cares. Groupon grew by scamming a bunch of small business owners who don't understand that to offer up stupidly expensive promotions usually for little long term or meaningful  is no good thing.   Any idiot can give away free money but you cannot build a long term business where the suppliers (the small businesses) get Burned. [Sure there were some good offers and some people  got what they bargained for but many did not come out the other side with results that made sense from a business point of view]. Consumers also wise up that a cheap thing you don't need or use is not a bargain.  Also bombard me with offers 24/7 and I just switch Off all together.

There is a sustainable business for Groupon but it isn't half as sexy or interesting as people think.  Think junk mail in a sexy wrapper.
