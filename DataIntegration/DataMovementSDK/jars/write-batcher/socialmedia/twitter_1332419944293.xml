A lesson for the dick below:

Global Warming?....What Global Warming?

Met Office releases new HadCRUt3 figures which show no warming over the past 15 years despite the largest increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the Industrial  began.

The CO2 Increase of more than 28 ppmv since 1997 has resulted in NO mean global temperature increase. The planet is at the same 14.34 degrees Celsius now as it was 15 years ago.

RSS data confirms no warming and in factÂ  shows a slight cooling since 1997.

Background

The Earth has been warming up since the last Ice Age and has Reached circa 14.0 to 14.5 deg C today. However, it should be noted that the temperature of the Earth has been as low as 10 degrees C and as high as 25+ deg C putting the past 15 years temperatures closer to the lower end of the geological reconstructions than the higher end. Scotese shows the maxima and minima as well as long term cycles of warm through to Cold and so on.
