We truly need to sign another PG and another big, it's obvious at  this point (no pun intended). Baron would have been nice if were healthy, but it doesn't seem like he's going to be rust/injury-free at any point (again, no pun intended). Now with Lin out he's not going to have time to get healthy.

Is Mike James available? Next year I would look at Andre Miller.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67kd85</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lilw</id></website><link>http://www.theknicksblog.com/2012/03/31/melo-stepping-up-fans-settling-in/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:49:39+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T16:35:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mww76c</id><link>http://www.theknicksblog.com/2012/03/31/melo-stepping-up-fans-settling-in/#comment-481976283</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c9w0e</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
