Blimey! The stupid woman was p*ssing around with petrol in the house near a naked flame for God's sake. Now be serious!As i said in my other post, the vapour Burns, not the petrol, Â but the flash explosion caused her to drop the "jug", and it was that which caused her Burns.Btw, there is NO mention of how badly she was Burned. 40% Burns simply means 40% coverage, it doesn't say what DEGREE those Burns were, so you are making this whole thing up that she faces a "life of disfigurement &amp; skin grafts". You are making that up so as to make your post sound more emotionally charged.Sh*t happens (as they say), get over yourself. Â I've blown myself up with petrol before as a kid as I said in my other post, and i don't want your sympathy either; keep your sympathy, it was MY experience, I did it, it was MY fault, and I learned from it. That's how life works. You screw up, you learn from it.She wont do it again will she! Now she knows.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z3wyz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/fuel/9175292/Fuel-strike-petrol-delivery-backlog-reaches-two-to-three-days-warns-motor-trade-union.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:39:52+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:12:45+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwmn12</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/fuel/9175292/Fuel-strike-petrol-delivery-backlog-reaches-two-to-three-days-warns-motor-trade-union.html#comment-480723552</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8ro2g</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
