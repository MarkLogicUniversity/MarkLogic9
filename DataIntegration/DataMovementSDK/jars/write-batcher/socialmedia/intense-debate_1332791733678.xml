Really? Anyone can write a wiki. Here is a much more reliable source:

http://aspcabehavior.org/articles/193/The-Truth-About-Pit-Bulls.aspxÂ 

After reading that, maybe you will understand that pit bull is not a breed, but many different breeds. lump anything together, and naturally the numbers will be higher. Also, no official entity tracks bites by breed. The CDC used to, but stopped in 1998, due to gross amounts of misidentification. The ASPCA also conducted DNA testing on so called pit bulls, and 75% of them had no pit bulls DNA, and the vast majority of the remainder were mutts, meaning they were not purebred pit bulls. Not knocking you, but rather informing you. You can take it or leave it, but blaming a dog that cannot be Banned in CA does nothing at all but create a witch Burning mentality.
