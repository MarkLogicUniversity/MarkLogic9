No one should have preferential status under the law. Bill 13 is not about "inclusion" it's about enforcing sexuality and excluding heterosexuals. Bill 13 sounds like it was written by children: "we'll protect Billy and Sardeep and Sally, but not Bradley because he's mean"... The Bill even uses the word "queer" as one of the preferred groups.... Queer. Do queers even like being called queers? I thought that was like using the 'n-word' with blacks... A Bill, an Act of Parliament, says we are going to provide special treatement for "queers".... How will that street slang sound in 20 years, 40? It's a pathetic social reengineering document that tried to do the right thing for the wrong reasons.

You should take your own advice, mind your own business. Other people than you are allowed to have opinions. "In your face" gays are just asÂ good, if not better,Â at being bullies as the young boys swimming in adolescent testosterone-soup. The worst offenders that I have seen in my children's high schools are in fact female-orientals. They form groups known as "Asian clubs" and decry how they are not "white-washed" by canadian music, and talk down to the white students telling them how much smarter orientals are. Should we have a Bill 13b to address "queerly white, quasi sexual children"? No, of course not.

Bill 13 is a jokeÂ to mollifyÂ the "gay-lesbian-etc-ad Nausea" vocal special interest groups. Bill 14 is a responsible approach to combatting some of theÂ darker nature of puberty and socialization.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zubsh</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zsj8</id></website><link>http://www.torontosun.com/2012/03/29/time-to-compromise-on-anti-bullying-bills</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:58:37+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:21:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwm9bm</id><link>http://www.torontosun.com/2012/03/29/time-to-compromise-on-anti-bullying-bills#comment-480731263</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gxvd9</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
