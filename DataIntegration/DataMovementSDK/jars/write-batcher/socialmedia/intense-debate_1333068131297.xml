The police officers, who did arrive at the scene and saw Zimmerman, questioned him and did not arrest him. Why ? If he stated that he was attacked, and there were no signs that was possible, they would have arrested him on the Spot. I don't like to ask this, but ... if Martin had been the neighborhood watch guy and shot Zimmerman... would the media have played it up like this ? Or, if Zimmerman and Martin both had been black ? One other thing... isn't it a coincidence that all of this is playing, just as the Supreme Court is considering Obamacare ? Are they trying to give us something to take our minds Off the fact that Kagan did not recuse herself ? Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it ?</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zh9u0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/o6hq</id></website><link>http://conservativebyte.com/2012/03/does-george-zimmerman-appear-unscathed-in-new-police-video/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:39:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:22:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3n0pu</id><link>http://conservativebyte.com/2012/03/does-george-zimmerman-appear-unscathed-in-new-police-video/#comment-479670107</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
