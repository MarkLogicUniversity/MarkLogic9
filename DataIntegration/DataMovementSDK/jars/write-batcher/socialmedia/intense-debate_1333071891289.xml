This is the first time she's ever been Spotted at a Dr's office, but the paps stalk her so much. Which one is it ? I'm sure the assistant called ahead to let the paps know she would be there. I bet the paps themselves ask why do she call us everyday, but run and hide like we are stalking her ? I'm not buying the paps know Beyonce's entire schedule and knew she would be at the Dr. They ride around in that big as attention hoing van, keep the paps on speed Dial, but try to play us like we are crazy.


I'm so sick of Beyonce I like Beyonce.Â  I have never seen anyone thirstier for the flashing lights, but if that's what float Beyonce boat, the flash of a camera so be it. I'd rather Beyonce get back to music vs attention ho n blu every day. She has become nothing but a Ciara with a baby. You don't work or do ish. You run around town all day looking for the flashing lights with a baby in tow smh at thirsty Beyonce.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zlsx8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/45f2</id></website><link>http://bossip.com/564735/poor-thang-mommy-banger-beybey-wont-let-lil-blue-ivy-carter-get-her-shine-on-plus-auntie-solo30346/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:01:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:14:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3xwex</id><link>http://bossip.com/564735/poor-thang-mommy-banger-beybey-wont-let-lil-blue-ivy-carter-get-her-shine-on-plus-auntie-solo30346/#comment-479714637</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
