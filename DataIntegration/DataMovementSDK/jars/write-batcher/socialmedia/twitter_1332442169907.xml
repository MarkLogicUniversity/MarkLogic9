I'm sorry for your disappointment, but it is what it is.Â  Some guys get this and some guys don't.Â  I'd love to see Austin back in the ring, but I also know that he is probably doing just fine without the pain of being a full-time wrestler.Â  He retired at the end of his prime and is remembered for what he did.Â  Guys like Sting, Flair, and Hogan are legends, but they are past their prime and doing nothing to further their legacy.Â  If anything, the younger generation of fans will not see them as the great stars that we see them.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yua7o</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/e1x9</id></website><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0322/550916/john-cena/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:04:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T18:11:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miczqz</id><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0322/550916/john-cena/#comment-473810522</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ycbdq</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
