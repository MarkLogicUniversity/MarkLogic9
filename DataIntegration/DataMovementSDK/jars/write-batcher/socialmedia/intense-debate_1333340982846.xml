Second, he could have had his red jacket zipped up and you wouldn't be able to see any blood on his red jacket in that video. Third, and most importantly, why would there be blood on Zimmerman'sÂ clothes at all? Blood doesn't spew out of bullet wounds in reality like it does in the movies. Clothing absorbs it. Zimmerman didn't stay under Martin long enough for Martin's clothes to become so saturated with blood that it started dripping on him.
