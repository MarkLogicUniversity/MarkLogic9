You see the world through your spectacles, I see it through mine.Â  YouÂ view that  as a disaster, and then Mike the expatriate (take you more seriously if you actually livedÂ here) rhapsodizes about the eightiesÂ .Â  I am sure he picked the 80's because that was the  of Reagan.Â  You're right, there were no drug problems and no drug casulaties in the 80's, may be besides ectasy and crack.Â  And we surely didn't have to worry about PTSD because everytime there was an opportunity for confrontation, Ronnie was either a bully (Grenada and that quick little airstrike over Libya) or he ran (Lebanon).

Every Era has its up and downs, but at least through the sixties there was the offer of hope. Today, and probably starting in the 80's, just greed and self interest.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z244q</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/egg0</id></website><link>http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/03/29/romneys_russia_comments_reflect_long-held_distrust_113652-comments.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T03:04:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:23:16+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3tsdo</id><link>http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/03/29/romneys_russia_comments_reflect_long-held_distrust_113652-comments.html#comment-479525500</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lg4e1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
