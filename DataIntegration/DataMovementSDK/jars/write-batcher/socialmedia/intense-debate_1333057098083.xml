You don't know that the system had failed to move.Â  Zimmerman was arrested and charges were considered.Â Â  In the immediate aftermath of Martin's death charges were not laid but you don't know whether at that moment a decision had been  to NEVER lay charges.Â Â  

I'm not being cynical and Cold and neither are the many like Weisbrot who are cautioning against a rush to judgement and a gutting of due process, the preumption of innocence and all the other Safeguards that are there for good reason.

Now, as for your linkage, could it be that the death of Jews in Paris allegedly at the hands of Hassan Diab doesn't really matter to you?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lf7ms</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rhuw</id></website><link>http://drdawgsblawg.ca/2012/03/conservatism-not-a-politics-4.shtml</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T15:55:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:43:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m34mrm</id><link>http://drdawgsblawg.ca/2012/03/conservatism-not-a-politics-4.shtml#comment-479539843</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gdjmx</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
