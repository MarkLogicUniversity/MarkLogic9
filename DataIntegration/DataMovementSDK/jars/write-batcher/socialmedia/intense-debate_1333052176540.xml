Cam, Tolbert, Williams, Stewart, Smith, Olsen.Â  Defense Secondaries can't hang back because of the Run, Screen and Swing pass out of Back Field by four different weapons. Steve Smith will Burn you on a Blitz if you are not careful. This year i see Gettis breaking out and Edwards improving. In my opinion Edwards has been missed used by a long ways. Just look at what he done at ASU. They need to develop a few plays where he can pass as well as catch the ball. If they can run a trick play where all the Offensive line can stand there and not move and score ( coolest play ever ) then they can use Edwards strengths as a quarterback as well. Then if our Defense is ranked at least Fifth overall i think we have a chance at the Big Show. But I do believe the Defense will be Ranked First or Second. With Beason &amp; Davis coming back i think it will take some pressure Off the secondary, but i would like to see some improvements in that area. Godfrey is Great and Munnerlyn is a good Nickle but we need one more fast shut down corner. All in all i can't wait for the Panther's to pounce.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hjptn</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnei</id></website><link>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/28/3133853/seattle-coach-look-out-for-cam.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T19:17:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:36:44+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3tmv5</id><link>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/28/3133853/seattle-coach-look-out-for-cam.html#comment-479493364</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g24du</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
