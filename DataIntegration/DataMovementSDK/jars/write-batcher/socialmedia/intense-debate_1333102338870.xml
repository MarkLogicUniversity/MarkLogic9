You can't tell me if he was Bleeding from his nose and the paramedics checked it they didn't discover it was broken then... Same with his head being banged repetedly upon the concrete... If that is the cae he would have had been took to the hospital for observation for a possible concussion which is SOP (standard operating procedure) for paremedics due to the fact a concussion can kill you later and it makes them liable... That is why head injuries almost 99% of the time get transported to a hospital for 24 hour observation...

Also, the other interesting I read originally is that the body was found in the grass between 2 residences where there was no sidewalk or concrete anywhere close... So how did they go from bashing his head on the concrete to dead in the grass no where near the concrete... Most of this stuff doesn't add up...

I am not taking sides, just trying to figure out how all the things have changed since the incident originally occured.. And why heÂ supposedly had his head bashed against the concrete several times and was never checked for a concussion or it was noticed he had a broken nose in the original checkup... If anyone has ever had a broken knose it is very painful and if it was Bleeding and they wiped the blood Off it would have hurt tremendously...

So, as far as the injuries goes, I have to state IMO only, they do not add up with the original reports/storys posted when it happened...</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zcxr4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:16:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:59:44+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3j038</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-479996822</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cvu49</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
