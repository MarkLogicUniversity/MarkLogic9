I myself think all the coverage on what the justices asked, what they focused on, is totally Off base. the justices operate in a different kind of universe. they are not really getting much new information from these oral arguments. they are testing arguments they know well already, hoping to be surprised. they rarely are.Â 

and yes, they are not immune to grandstanding in my opinion. but what they will really rule is not signaled by what questions they ask here. they are probing for weak Spots; checking the arguments.Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hju1u</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/eyjq</id></website><link>http://m.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2012/03/the-horde-on-health-care/255186/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T19:10:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T22:42:05+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3cncf</id><link>http://m.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2012/03/the-horde-on-health-care/255186/#comment-478856581</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cc7mj</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
