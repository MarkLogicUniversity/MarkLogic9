Until then, I am going to go with 50%.Â  You will notice that the 50% true is a determination of truth for something that is next to impossible to prove as to causation.Â  For instance, how could you prove the preposterous notion that Obama (a CIC who doesn't bat an eye about killing people overseas) sets a good example for blacks and so violent crime has gone down?Â
