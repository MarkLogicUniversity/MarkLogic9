Both parties are wrong. Â You're both addicted to spending and deficits and you simply cannot assert that Ryan is any better.Â 

What he proposes still carries a deficit, but yet insists on more tax breaks for people who aren't the jobs creators. Â On what level does not taxing dividends and capital Gains make sense to you? Â 

Why do you guys keep proposing trickle down? Â It doesn't work. Â 

If the goal is to stimulate the economy, we know that the majority of job creation in the US is from companies with 1-100 employees. Â That's the sweet Spot.Â 

Instead of putting a 0% tax rate on trust fund dividend income, why not intelligently distribute tax relief where it is likely to have a GDP multiplier?Â 

So we learned that Bush 1.0 did not work. Â Ryan's plan is Bush 2.0 on steroids. Â 

The "savings" are just by passing the expense of health care to the seniors so we're effectively just raising their taxes, yet the largest dollars in tax savings will be going to the upper 10%.
