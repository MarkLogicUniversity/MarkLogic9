A lot of people were telling me to try the Bioderma but unfortunately I can't get a hold of it and would really love to try it out. My current favourite skincare product (if it countd as one) is Simple make up wipes I got from the pharmacy. It has no alcohol or bad bacteria in it and it hydrates my skin really well and hasn't broken me out like other make up wipes. I love your channel and hopefully the Bioderma (if you pick me!) works well on me like it does on you. xx</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l94h3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4ib9</id></website><link>http://www.fleurdeforce.com/articles/158/</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T16:46:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:13:08+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwmn3p</id><link>http://www.fleurdeforce.com/articles/158/#comment-480723905</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zz0qp</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
