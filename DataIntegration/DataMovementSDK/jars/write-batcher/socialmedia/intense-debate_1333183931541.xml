DAMASCUS // Two months after tanks retook Saqba from rebels, the district in eastern Damascus continues to protest against regime control and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) is making a gradual comeback.

 A powerful force involving thousands of troops assaulted Saqba at the end of January. The operation to reassert authority coincided with the Arab League's decision to freeze its observer mission to Syria in the face of escalating violence.

Troops from the well-equipped and ultra loyalist Republican Guard, commanded by the president's brother, Mahar Al Assad, seized the Sunni majority suburb in little more than 48 hours, according to regime supporters who saw the attack take place.

It had been held by the FSA, a small band of lightly armed defectors who, in preceding weeks, had wrested it from government control, pushing out the feared  police.

Since the assault, army checkpoints have been established at entrances to the district, and security forces have set up ad hoc bases in some of the concrete residential blocks that, together with hundreds of furniture workshops, make up much of the suburb.

 At night army units patrol through the area, residents say, often shooting into the air or at stray cats and dogs, or chanting their loyalty to the ruling Assad family.

Much of the anti-regime graffiti scrawled on walls during the brief period of rebel control has been crossed out and replaced with pro-regime slogans, including "Assad or no one" and "Assad or we Burn the country".

But while the military offensive and a subsequent campaign of Raids and arrests reestablished a government presence in the streets, it failed to deliver a decisive blow against the uprising.

Deep inside Saqba's maze of streets, alleyways and dirt lots grazed by goats, anti-regime messages are still written on the sides of buildings, rubbish bins and electrical transformer stations.

Regular protests continue. Smaller than before the military entered, activists admit, but still involving as many as 1,000 young demonstrators.

 Recently, the FSA has resumed attacks on government checkpoints on the outskirts of the area. On Tuesday night heavy clashes were reported in Saqba and neighbouring Kafr Batna by the Local Coordination Committees LCC), a network of grassroots activists.

A pro-regime craftsman who works in Saqba said guerrilla operations had resumed against regime targets inside the security cordon.

"I thought the army entering Saqba had finished everything but now the FSA are reborn and they seem to have a new strategy," he said. "They leave their weapons in Saqba, come in from outside, carry out their attacks and then leave again to hide in the rural areas."

"It [the uprising] is not finished in Saqba, the government doesn't have full control and if the troops left the FSA would return and take it back," he said.

 At least 29 people were killed in the January assault and hundreds more wounded according to Saqba activists and human rights monitors. They also say informants working inside the army have told them the location of a mass grave, although the continued heavy security presence means they have been unable to approach the area to check if the report is true.

"We have still not recovered all of the bodies, we're not certain who was killed, who is missing who was arrested," said a leading activist from the district, who is wanted for failing to report for compulsory military service.
