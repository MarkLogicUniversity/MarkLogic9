I am having a heck of a time with her and Diarrhea. I never had problems with my mix dogs I have owned previously. She has been to the vet several times already but there is nothing wrong with her. She picks up stuff outside and eats it of course. However, when she is on the meds, metronidazole, I have no issues at all. As soon as I stop a pill, Diarrhea again. She was on Iams Smart puppy, but into the second bag, she began the Diarrhea. I now switched her food to Authority puppy but now was told she may be allergic to grains. I bought some Blue puppy but I just cannot afford the price of it. HELP. What can I give her to help her Diarrhea? I cannot have this go on all night long every night and she cannot stay on these antibiotics.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/d4bfaw</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ukja</id></website><link>http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/frequently-asked-questions/health-problems/</link><postedTime>2011-12-24T18:09:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T14:38:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mp04rs</id><link>http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/frequently-asked-questions/health-problems/#comment-473628812</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zdd1l</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-12-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
