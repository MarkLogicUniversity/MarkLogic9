To quote Pitchfork (I'm not usually one to quote Pitchfork because often their ideas about music are too out there for me, but this one was Spot-on): "'We Found Love' ranks among Ri's best singles because it recognizes that there's not much more that needs to be said: in three and a half minutes, the line moves from being a great pop lyric to a triumphant mantra to something suggestive of a whole spectrum of unspoken emotion. The best pop music transports you to somewhere beyond words, and Rihanna's strongest singles all seem to be in on this Secret. Need I remind you of some of her most powerful hooks:Â Ella-ella-ella-ay.Â Oh-na-na.Â Ay-ayy-ay-ayy-ay-ayy."
Umbrella was, hands down, my favorite pop song of the '00s because it had the perfect combination of a clever concept, great lyrics with a nice hook, warm-but-not-overly-warm vocals, and great production. We Found Love is quite similar, though without any cutesy concept behind it. I feel like maybe it could have had a bit more lyrical depth, but it still packed an emotional punch while being incredibly catchy. I think your problem with We Found Love and Umbrella is the same as my problem with Since U Been Gone and Toxic: personal taste.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zijro</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/march-31-2012,71681/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T05:02:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T08:16:55+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0jfek</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/march-31-2012,71681/#comment-483342151</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lbsqh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
