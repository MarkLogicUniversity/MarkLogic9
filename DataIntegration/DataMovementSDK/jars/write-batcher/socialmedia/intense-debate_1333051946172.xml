I was waiting for someone to tryÂ and throw Cold water on  convincing win at Bay Hill. If they had an ounce of journalistic cleverness, the story should have been  getting revenge on McDowell who stole the Chevron and on Phil who embarassed him at Pebble Beach. Phil beat  by 9 at Pebble Beach and  beat Phil by 12 at Bay Hill. But they're not clever enough to come up with that obvious storyline. They would rather continue to dig at  and pass out their backhanded compliments. If  wins the Masters they will probably say "but theÂ weather was unseasonably warm".Â 

It's just their way of getting back at  forÂ not coming on their stupid shows and helping their ratings. I don't blame Tiger, I wouldn't give them the time of day.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rx7ij</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zuso</id></website><link>http://web.tigerwoods.com/news/article/2012032527611220/news</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T01:16:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:32:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3tgvc</id><link>http://web.tigerwoods.com/news/article/2012032527611220/news#comment-479490771</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/yaj19</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
