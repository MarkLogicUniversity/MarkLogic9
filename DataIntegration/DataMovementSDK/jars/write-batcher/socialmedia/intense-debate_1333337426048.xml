Â The position adopted by the government was that the Court, if bringing down the mandate, should also bring down guaranteed issue and community rating. Â That seems to me an unwise position, inviting the Court to mix and match provisions in the manner of a legislative markup session. Â It is no  that the primary ,and perhaps even the only, reason the government took that tack was to reinforce the argument that the mandate was essential. Â As I said in my initial post, if the mandate were to be struck, I would hope the government would still walk away with community rating, guaranteed issue, and the Medicaid expansion.

Secondarily, I saw potential complexity arising if a conservative majority for striking the mandate Â sought to articulate a limiting principle that somehow  between "Wick-Burn/Raich" and the instant case. Â If that effort is as hopeless as urban legend (among many others) think, it may suffice to say that writing the conservative side of Bush v. Gore was complex as well. Â Utter junk to be sure, but complex utter junk.

As to whether "Wick-Burn/Raich" can be actually distinguished from the case at hand, I am a skeptic, but ultimately an agnostic. Â A few years back, a unit of local government in Georgia decided to require that each household own a gun. Â I think that such an exercise of the police power may well touch on a fundamental right to be left alone, free to decline to enter contracts one deems repugnant. I, for one, would not be entirely unhappy if a majority of the Court announced such a right. Â Were it to do so, moreover, it would surely make the rule one of general applicability and there would be no need for the "this trip only" antics of Bush v Gore. Â 

All that said, I think the federal interest in the mandate is compelling and the mandate is narrowly tailored to that interest. Â The mandate should survive even if such a right is announced. Â Is the determination of compelling interest and Â narrow fitting a simple one? Â Not really.Â 

For one thing, perhaps only a catastrophic policy need be mandated. Â As it turns out, the lowest coverage option under the ACA has an actuarially determined deductible which varies  on market conditions. Â Current estimates of what the deductible will by range between $2000 and $6500. Â Since either level satisfies the current requirements for tax favored treatment of health savings accounts, I would indeed say that the mandate is narrowly tailored to achieve the Act's objectives. Â The fact that the Solicitor General did not make that very point when Scalia badgered him about catastrophic coverage is itself an indication that a full analysis of a clash between an exercise of the Commerce power and some sort of important right to be free of repugnant contracts is not so simple.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67moej</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ydw9</id></website><link>http://motherjones.com/node/170036</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:07:17+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T16:48:31+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mww18x</id><link>http://motherjones.com/node/170036#comment-481987677</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rycfo</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
