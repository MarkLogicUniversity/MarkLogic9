&#13; 
FOR THE TERM OF HIS NATURAL LIFE&#13; 
Rejected by the husband of Lady Divine (Dianne Cilento) a young aristocrat Richard Divine (Colin Friels) is disinherited. To protect his mother from subsequent scandal he assumes the name Rufus Dawes and is given a timepiece by his natural father. Later he is falsely accused of stealing it arrested and transported to a British Penal colony in Van Diemenâ€™s Land (Tasmania). Constantly harassed by a cruel and devious Lieutenant Frere (Rod Mullinar) the articulate Mr Dawes learns how to survive the harshness of colonial imprisonment and at some stage tends the garden of the Colony Commandants home. After saving the lives of the Colony Commandantâ€™s wife and child Sylvia, Lieutenant Frere promises Dawes a full pardon only to later betray him and take credit himself. Suffering some memory loss from the survival ordeal and soon after death of her mother Sylvia cannot help her convict friend she used to call â€œThe good Mr Dawesâ€&#157;. Aided by the troubled Reverend North (Anthony Perkins) who sees the cruel injustices of the penal settlement he finally escapes to the goldfields of Victoria. Sylvia who now as a young woman (Penelope Stewart) has since married the Lieutenant not realising his manipulation or betrayal. Meanwhile another convict escapee who had earlier learned of Rufus Dawes background assumed the aristocrat identity of Richard Divine and has been blackmailing his mother. This story has many interlocking elements that eventually lead to his return to England to an unconditional pardon and a romantic ending.&#13; 
&#13; 
Marcus Clarkeâ€™s book was acclaimed by none other than Mark Twain himself is stated on the DVD overview. This miniseries adaptation second only to Rich Man Poor Man.&#13; 
&#13; 
CHIEFS&#13; 
This riveting miniseries is about a serial killer that manages to avoid capture over a period of decades while living in the fictional southern town of Delanor. Charlton Heston narrates the story at intervals as well as  his role as a founding father of the town as he watches it grow unaware of the dark history of hidden graves and the young hitch hiking runaways that lay in them. The community has its other issues to add to the tension with racism. The title Chiefs relates to the different police chiefs appointed over the period with the last one (a black man) to add to the plot. A great ending to. I would rate this miniseries within the top half dozen ever produced.&#13; 
&#13; 
CAPTAINS AND THE KINGS&#13; 
On arriving in New York as young catholic Irish teenage immigrant Joseph Armagh is left orphaned with his two younger siblings. Bitter but with an honourable sense of wanting to pay his way he is filled with ambition and convinced that money is all that really matters. He takes risk some illegal to realise his ambition and becomes wealthy and influential but less human. Money and the power that comes with it make Joe a man that can manipulate political and world events. Along with other men like him he can make presidents. But ambition without compassion catches up eventually.&#13; 
Yes! We can see where Taylor Caldwell drew the storyline from but still a great miniseries.&#13; 
&#13; 
ROCKET MAN&#13; 
This six part BBC miniseries that has not been officially released stars Robson Green as the widowed father of a teenage daughter and a younger son. Struggling with the loss of his wife Bethany, George works in a chocolate factory while pursuing his passion to build a rocket to send Bethanyâ€™s ashes into space. This story was both poignant and hilariously funny at other times. Unfortunately after being absolutely brilliant for the first three episodes it seemed to lose direction some way into the fourth and had become marred with some stupid childish scenes to a disappointing and less than worthy ending.  &#13; 
&#13; 
MASADA&#13; 
A miniseries you will watch till the end. The Roman commander Flavius Silva (Peter O\'Toole) has orders from Rome to remove a group of Jewish Zealots from the Judean desert fortress Masada. The rebel leader Eleazar Ben Yair (Peter Strauss) through Silva had tried to broker a peace with the Roman council but it has been rejected. Silva has respect for the rebel leader and is sympathetic to their cause but at the same time has his orders. Choosing freedom over oppression the rebel leader is a clever adversary for a commander struggling with his conscience.&#13; 
The siege of Masada begins.&#13; 
One criticism I have was a particular scene where in rebuilding the fortress wall it was sort of ridiculous to see one of the rebels carrying a huge timber beam on his shoulder like a piece of foam (probably what it was). As the timbers were to be slow Burning a beam such as this would have to have weighed well over a ton.&#13; 
&#13; 
THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH&#13; 
So great to get back to the true miniseries that tells a story from beginning to end and not written week to week, season to season to keep an audience. As for the Acting I thought Ian McShane as the treacherous Bishop Waleran did a good job while Sam Claflin as Richard was not as convincing as a conquering Knight and at times a little wooden in his performance. Rufus Sewell as Tom Builder and each of the female leads were all good. The bloody and gruesome battle scenes were shorter than you would expect from this kind of epic while the germ of the stories focus was more about the ambitions of each of the main characters as they manoeuvred to achieve what each of them wanted.&#13; 
&#13; 
CENTENNIAL&#13; 
Centennial was entertaining while educational and now so relevant with todayâ€™s concerns about the environment. James Mitchener obviously had an appreciation for what is important to take care of and remember. This was great story reflecting on the cost to the American Indians the indifference to their needs their pride and humiliation. The pioneering and fortunes of the early settlers their different backgrounds.&#13; 
Robert Conrad plays a great part as Pasquinel as does Alex Karas as Hans Brumbaugh, Raymond Burr and Richard Chamberlain strong also but David Jansen wooden.&#13; 
&#13; 
PRIDE AND PREDUDICE&#13; 
Jane Austinâ€™s book has turned into one of the most acclaimed miniseries ever produced. Darcy (Colin Firth) and Lizzy (Jennifer Ehle) lead with a host of other solid performances in a series that you donâ€™t have to be a woman to enjoy or appreciate and it sits in my top six.&#13; 
&#13; 
RICH MAN POOR MAN&#13; 
The forerunner of all TV miniseries Irwin Shawâ€™s story still holds up as the best ever produced. Nick Nolte as Tom and Ed Azner as his father gave the best performances of their careers and made this the success it was. &#13; 
Unlike so many other miniseries, the story line has some depth and sends us a question of what success and happiness are all about. I also picked up on the blooper in filming the World Trade Centre. That was built in 1973 well after the time frame of the story.&#13; 
&#13; 
ROOTS&#13; 
Roots acclaimed as one of the all time best miniseries boast some classic performances&#13; 
Ed Azner as he did in Rich Man Poor Man again terrific also Brad Davis as he was in Chiefs. The young Kunta Kinte played by Levar Burton and Kizzie by Leslie Uggams as well amongst a host of great performances. The story is well known so no need for me to repeat it. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:186675:54669026</id><idPostId>54669026</idPostId><idBlogId>186675</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:186675</id><idBlogId>186675</idBlogId><link>http://listverse.com</link><displayName>Listverse</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://listverse.com/2010/09/28/top-15-miniseries-of-all-time</link><displayName>Top 15 Miniseries of all Time</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:21:45.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:186675:54669026:328176674</id><link>http://listverse.com/2010/09/28/top-15-miniseries-of-all-time#IDComment328176674</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:21:45.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Top 15 Miniseries of all Time by warren</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link/><idEmailMd5>7a4898408b4e2902b4895678bc30324b</idEmailMd5><displayName>warren</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>warren commented on &lt;a href="http://listverse.com/2010/09/28/top-15-miniseries-of-all-time"&gt;Top 15 Miniseries of all Time&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
