Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death. Â Such evil must be purged from Israel.Â Â (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)Â 

"If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives."Â  (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)Â 

A man or a woman who  as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death.Â  (Leviticus 20:27 NAB)Â 

1)Â If one curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out at the coming of darkness.Â Â (Proverbs 20:20 NAB)Â Â Â Â 2)Â All who curse their father or mother must be put to death.Â  They are guilty of a capital offense.Â  (Leviticus 20:9 NLT)A priest's daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be Burned to death.Â  (Leviticus 21:9 NAB)Â They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.Â  (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB *Notice this verse says exactly what you claim the Quor'an says!)Â Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods.Â  In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully.Â  If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable Act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.Â  Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and Burn it.Â  Put the entire town to the torch as a Burnt offering to the LORD your God.Â  That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.Â  Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction.Â  Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you.Â  He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors.Â  "The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him."Â  (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)But if this charge is trueÂ (that she wasn't a virgin on her wedding night), and evidence of the girls virginity is not found, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father's house.Â  Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.Â  (DeuteronomyÂ  22:20-21 NAB)Â The glory of Israel will fly away like a bird, for your children will die at birth or perish in the womb or never even be conceived.Â  Even if your children do survive to grow up, I will take them from you.Â  It will be a terrible day when I turn away and leave you alone.Â  I have watched Israel become as beautiful and pleasant as Tyre.Â  But now Israel will bring out her children to be slaughtered."Â  O LORD, what should I request for your people?Â  I will ask for wombs that don't give birth and breasts that give no milk.Â  The LORD says, "All their wickedness began at Gilgal; there I began to hate them.Â  I will drive them from my land because of their evil actions.Â  I will love them no more because all their leaders are rebels.Â  The people of Israel are stricken.Â  Their roots are dried up; they will bear no more fruit.Â  And if they give birth, I will slaughter their beloved children."Â  (Hosea 9:11-16 NLT)Â AND, as not to exclude the NEW TESTIMENT, the so called "NEW covenant"So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. Â As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies.Â  Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies. Â So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever. Â Amen. Â That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Â Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.Â  And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with women, Burned with lust for each other. Â Men did shameful things with other men and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly deserved. Â When they refused to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their evil minds and let them do things that should never be done.Â  Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, fighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip.Â  They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. Â They are forever inventing new ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents.Â  They refuse to understand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving.Â  They are fully aware of God's death penalty for those who do these things, yet they go right ahead and do them anyway. Â And, worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.Â Â (Romans 1:24-32 NLT)Grew up in "church", SUGARLIPS, come correct or don't come at all.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zh9n5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/hwxn</id></website><link>http://floridaindependent.com/73921/terry-jones-republican-liberty-caucus</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:38:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:27:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ubxp</id><link>http://floridaindependent.com/73921/terry-jones-republican-liberty-caucus#comment-479792945</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
