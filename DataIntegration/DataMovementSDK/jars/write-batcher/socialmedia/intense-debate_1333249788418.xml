Since he is a "religious leader" and not some lay person, I think his opinion is important. I think it is completely asinine that decent people who reject the supernatural can be told they get to sit by the campfire for eternity while vile monsters can skip through meadows with baby-jesus (as long as they repent on their deathbed).
I am trying to figure out how morally destitute the situation is.

"Fr. Moyle, your peers who committed Acts against children...will they Burn in hell for their sins? Or is that a reward only for non-catholics? This is a forthright question, request a forthright answer. Do priests who commit the gravest sins get forgiven in your doctrine? But decent atheists and non-catholics get to wallow in torment?"
