&lt;b&gt;Warden:&lt;/b&gt;Â Taking a leisurely strole, were we?
&lt;b&gt;Teddy Daniels:&lt;/b&gt;Â I was uh...just...just looking around.
&lt;b&gt;Warden:&lt;/b&gt;Â Did you enjoy god's latest gift?
&lt;b&gt;Teddy Daniels:&lt;/b&gt;Â What?
&lt;b&gt;Warden:&lt;/b&gt;Â God's gift.Â 
[points to the sky]
&lt;b&gt;Warden:&lt;/b&gt;Â The violence. When I came downstairs in my home and I saw a tree in my living room, it Reached out for me like a divine hand. God loves violence.
&lt;b&gt;Teddy Daniels:&lt;/b&gt;Â I...I hadn't noticed.
&lt;b&gt;Warden:&lt;/b&gt;Â Sure you have. Why else would there me so much of it? It's in us. It's what we are. We wage war, we Burn sacrifices and pillage and plunder and tear at the flesh of our brothers. And why? Because god gave us violence to wage in his honor.
&lt;b&gt;Teddy Daniels:&lt;/b&gt;Â I thought god gave us moral order.
&lt;b&gt;Warden:&lt;/b&gt;Â There's no moral order as pure as this storm. There's no moral order at all. There's just this; can my violence conquer yours?
&lt;b&gt;Teddy Daniels:&lt;/b&gt;Â I'm not violent.
&lt;b&gt;Warden:&lt;/b&gt;Â Yes, you are. You're as violent as they come. I know this because I'm as violent as they come. With the constraints of society we're lifted. And I was all that stood between you and me? You would crack my skull and eat my meaty parts. &lt;i&gt;Wouldn't you? But Cawley thinks that you're harmless, that you can be controlled. But I know different.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Teddy Daniels:&lt;/b&gt;Â You don't know me.
&lt;b&gt;Warden:&lt;/b&gt;Â Oh, but I do.
&lt;b&gt;Teddy Daniels:&lt;/b&gt;Â No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
&lt;b&gt;Warden:&lt;/b&gt;Â Oh, I know you. We've known each other for centuries</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67mdzt</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9176710/George-Galloway-is-no-friend-of-the-Arab-world.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T15:41:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T22:03:22+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw4sry</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9176710/George-Galloway-is-no-friend-of-the-Arab-world.html#comment-481251861</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rebn0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
