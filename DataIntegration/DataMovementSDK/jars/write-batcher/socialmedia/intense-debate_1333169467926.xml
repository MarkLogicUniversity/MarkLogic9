Robocalls? Now there is a non issue if ever there was but the media has decided it is critical that we get to the bottom of it or democracy as we know it will be destroyed! It just happens to be a convenient topic for lazy journalists and I, like many Canadians I'm sure, are bored to death with it.
I enjoy Ezra's TV Spot and his books. Mostly I enjoy watching him make the mainstream media, politicians and other blowhards really, really uncomfortable. Kind of like the Atkinson principles in reverse.
Keep it up Ezra.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6d2reh</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4r1e</id></website><link>http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/03/20/canadas-rush-limbaugh-jonathan-kay-on-the-maddenning-mind-of-ezra-levant/</link><postedTime>2012-03-20T16:50:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-21T13:21:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mpmtt2</id><link>http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/03/20/canadas-rush-limbaugh-jonathan-kay-on-the-maddenning-mind-of-ezra-levant/#comment-472321332</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lrusv</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-20</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
