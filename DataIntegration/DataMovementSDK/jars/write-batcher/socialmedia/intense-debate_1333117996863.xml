In the middle ages left handed people were Burned at the stake because they were thought to be in league with the devil. Â  Don't laugh, there are still places in the world today where my left hand might be cut Off in order to force me to become right handed.Â Â  

We are who we are and we are all part of some minority (left handed, blue eyes, anything other than O+ blood, etc.)Â  As long as our oddities don't hurt the people around us or infringe on the rights of others we need to respect those differences.Â  Comparing homosexuality to pedophilia is like comparing apples and oranges.Â  Pedophiles, whether they are straight or gay, break the law because they prey on unwilling children.Â  Homosexual adults engaging in consensual adult relationships are not harming anyone and should be left alone to live their lives as they see fit and that includes getting married if they want to.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h7ri8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/jpbk</id></website><link>http://theweek.com/article/index/226116/an-anti-gay-marriage-groups-extremist-strategy-4-revelations</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T14:45:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:36:44+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3fgp5</id><link>http://theweek.com/article/index/226116/an-anti-gay-marriage-groups-extremist-strategy-4-revelations#comment-479864488</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
