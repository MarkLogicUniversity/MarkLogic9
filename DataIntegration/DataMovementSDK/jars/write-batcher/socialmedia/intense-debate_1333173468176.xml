And, yes my left hand is sweaty at all times while in portrait, and right hand while in landscape position...

I expected some software bugs but not such problems as this one is.Â 

Many suggest to drain initial chinese left-over electricity and fully charge it; than I guess issue should not come back... I hardly believe this because if it is CPU / GPU /  and maybe even RAM causing the Heat - no help other than "good luck keeping one once you are out of return policy" ...Â 

I am likely to return mine to BestBuy within few days unless miracle happens...

Note: also, message for Apple - I DO NOT NEED YOUR COOL CASE to cool Off my hand, etc... keep your frying pan and that's it :)Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6eu4jf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/y2ru</id></website><link>http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/18/is-your-new-ipad-heating-up/</link><postedTime>2012-03-18T23:56:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-19T22:36:21+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mjtktq</id><link>http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/18/is-your-new-ipad-heating-up/#comment-469446823</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zg18c</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-18</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
