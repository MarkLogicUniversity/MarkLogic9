God shows me love towards people who have turned away because they believe their terrible lives were his fault. Blame Satan, not God. Take responsibility for any part of not following God's word which allowed the open door to the dark one to enter. If you repent and ask God to show you what he has in store for you, you will see as I do. What do you have to loose? I didn't Always believe. I was like you once. I was angry and sad that my life was so painful. Maybe you think people that believe in God have never had tribulations. It is the people that have suffered the most that believe in God.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lcs59</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rb19</id></website><link>/2012/03/26/reason-rally-in-washington-d-c/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:19:24+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:03:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3qbxl</id><link>/2012/03/26/reason-rally-in-washington-d-c/#comment-479606304</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/m0g97</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
