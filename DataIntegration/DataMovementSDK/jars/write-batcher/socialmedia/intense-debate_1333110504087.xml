Anti-energy crusaders are in a celebratory mood this week as the EPA effectively Banned the construction of coal-fired power plants, and thus completed the federal government’s trifecta beat-down on affordable energy.

First, new obstacles to energy production resulted in oil production on federal lands dropping 11% in Fiscal Year 2011 vs. 2010. Second, President Obama announced earlier this year that his administration was blocking construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that would deliver large quantities of valuable oil from neighboring Canada. Third, the EPA announced this week its severe global warming restrictions on power plants.

For all the talk of an “all of the above” federal energy policy, this administration is imposing “none of the above,” unless we choose to celebrate our imminent Burning of dung for fuel, like they do in the utopian economic powerhouse of Bangladesh.
