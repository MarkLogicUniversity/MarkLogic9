Zimmerman's conscience has to be eating at him like hot acid. Imagine how devastated he must have felt when he realized he had just killed a boy. National outrage will probably lead to his being arrested and charged (at least) with manslaughter. He probably breaks out in Cold sweats 1,000 times a day -- heart Palpitations; flushes of adrenalin; feelings of shame, depression, and guilt. No matter how often Zimmerman claims he Acted in "self-defense," he and the rest of the world knows he pursued and killed an innocent child without provocation.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lcg94</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/77ib</id></website><link>http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/26/police-reveal-george-zimmermans-side-of-the-trayvon-martin-shooting/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:46:42+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T23:54:16+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk3rcs</id><link>http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/26/police-reveal-george-zimmermans-side-of-the-trayvon-martin-shooting/#comment-476885372</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zruf4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
