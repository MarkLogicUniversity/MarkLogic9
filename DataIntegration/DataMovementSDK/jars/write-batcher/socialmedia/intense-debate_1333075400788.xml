For that I give Juan credit although our view may be at opposite ends of the spectrum. You have to give a man credit for telling you HIS truth; it does not mean you to agree with it but it gives you respect for him as a person. Juan has taken Heat for standing up for what he sees as the truth for that I take my hat Off to him. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zlhpj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/03/29/trayvon-martin-tragedies/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:37:33+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:57:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3bwzx</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/03/29/trayvon-martin-tragedies/#comment-479761581</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hk8v6</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
