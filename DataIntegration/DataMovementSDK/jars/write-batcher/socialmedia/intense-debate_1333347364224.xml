The witness reports that George Zimmerman was on the ground and 
Trayvon is on top of him punching him. The witness says that George 
Zimmerman was screaming and yelling for help. Police arrive and find 
Zimmerman Bleeding on his face and the back of his head. He also has had
 grass stains on his back. All this confirms the story told by Zimmerman
 and the witness. Police play the 911 tape for Trayvon Martin's father, 
who tells police that the voice screaming is not the voice of his son. 
Zimmerman was on the ground being punched when he shot Trayvon Martin.
The media also characterizes Trayvon as a "model student." In fact, 
he under a five day suspension when the shooting took place. That is why
 he was staying at a house so far from his school on a school night. A 
laywer for Trayvon's family has blocked access to his school records. 
However, you have to do something pretty bad to get suspended for five 
days.

A local news video report supports
much of the above. It claims prosecutors advised police they did not 
have enough evidence to win a manslaughter conviction. Zimmerman claims 
Martin attacked him, while Martin's Father said the voice heard calling 
for help was not his son, Trayvon Martin. If accurate, it would have 
been Zimmerman calling for help. The reports claims police also said 
Zimmerman's account was corroborated by witnesses.
Also, according to media reports, Martin was suspended for ten days, 
not five, for being in an unauthorized area on school property, not a 
violent behavioral issue, as the Miami Herald indicates he did have behavior problems of some non-violent type. Still, an Orlando Sentinel story quotes a teacher as saying he was suspended for being tardy and had no behavior issues.

Still, Trayvon had nonviolent behavioral issues in school, and on the
 day he was killed, he had been suspended for 10 days from Dr. Michael 
M. Krop Senior High School in North Miami-Dade.  â€œHe was not suspended 
for something dealing with violence or anything like that. It wasnâ€™t a 
crime he committed, but he was in an unauthorized area [on school 
property],â€&#157; Martin said, declining to offer more details.  Before that, 
Trayvon attended Miami Carol City High School near his motherâ€™s home in 
Miami Gardens.

He was visiting in an area 250 miles away from home with his Father at the time.



He would be 17 for 21 days. He died Feb. 26, a bullet in his chest, 
shot by a neighborhood crime watch captain patrolling a suburban gated 
townhouse community in Sanford, 250 miles from his home, where he had 
gone with his father after a school suspension.

While certain facts may remain in doubt, or disputed, what's 
increasingly clear is that by climbing over one another to get the 
story, mainstream media journalists appear to be adding more confusion, 
than clarity, to the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. However, that did
 not stop Barack Obama from weighing in, claiming if he had a son, it 
would look like Trayvon Martin. That may Depend on what photo of him 
he's seen, of course.
