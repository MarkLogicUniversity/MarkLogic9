Â I found a couple of waterlogged "fixer" surfboards on the beach and bought a VW bus. Â I walked away from a fully furnished apartment and a girlfriend who had just discovered cocaine and wanted to kill me. Â I did odd jobs for the next ten years and lived in three vans, two trees and three boats before I decided to head back to a normal reality. Â I thought I'd try the American dream. Â I bought a 3bd/2ba house with the two car garage full of toys, i.e. bikes, boats, etc. Â I put up a white picket fence around the property and landscaped the place. Â Then I saw some bums passing a bottle and remembered how Carefree that life was. Â I gave away everything I couldn't sell, and am back to everything I can fit in my sailboat. Â I'm planning a trip to the Bahamas, and if that goes well I'll head down to the Caribbean. Â I hadn't considered the idea of obtaining new identification. Â When I was living on the street everyone went by their first names and some other identifier like, "Guitar Randy", "Arizona Bob", etc. Â Given the fact that I've never married and have no children, it's pretty easy to just pick up and leave. Â Although I do have a cousin that bought a boat and sailed Â from Canada down to Central America with her husband and two children. Â I did experience some fear and Anxiety while I was getting rid of most of my stuff, but now that it's gone I feel great. Â I highly recommend it for anyone who is tired of the "rat race".
