Can you comprehend that?  Even with tthe massive spending we're stil borrowing forty cents of every dollar the government spends.  Incomprehensible!!  I mean at some point in the not to distant future Bernanke's funny money printing machine will Burn up and the chicoms will shut  the credit.   All of a sudden.....it's over.  People will continue to go about doing what they  do.....until the realization finally Dawns on folks the country has collapsed economically.  Then the nighmare scenario.....especially in the big metropolitan areas of the country. More frightening is the response of the obamaheads when they realize the food stamps, the free stuff, is kaaput. 

Now that I think about it.....maybe I should pick up another 500 rounds of 40 Cal S&amp;W....hollow points. I'm thinking I'll need those babies.
