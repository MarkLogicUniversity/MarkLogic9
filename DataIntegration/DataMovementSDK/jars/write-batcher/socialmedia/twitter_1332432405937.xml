The environmental movement is now being corporatized.
The Sierra Club
Environmental Defense Fund
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)
The largest sponsors of the RHH or Restore Hetch Hetchy that have almost exclusively corporate boards ... Our family had a membership in the Sierra Club for decades. Former Sierra Club president Adam Werbach  joined the payroll of Wal-Mart and Carl Pope came along and slandered its name with Clorox ... They are trying to rejigger their image now as Pope has stepped down but remains on the board as chairman ... but they are nothing but a shill for green washing corporate laundry.

Look at the Environmental Defense Funds's corporate board ...Â
