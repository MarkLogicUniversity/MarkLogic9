Thanks for the informative blog post.  We've just finished our first (and last) application of Certifect - and will never use it again.  My pup has a tough time with most flea/tick medications, so my vet suggested a "new" type of application as a last resort of sorts.  Three hours post-application, poor Tucker was outside in the yard rolling in his own (freshly produced) Diarrhea  - trying to get the smell .  Without knowing how intense the smell of the medicine was, we put him in the bathroom while we prepared to clean him .  We were nearly knocked  our feet when we came back five minutes later - entering the bathroom was like being hit by a wall of toxic fumes.  No wonder the poor guy wanted to roll it Off.  We'll call the vet tomorrow to let them know about our experiences, and forward your article to them. Thanks for the info.
