As an American born in the USA I can't believe some of the negative comments . In general in working with folks from the UK , which includes Englishmen they Always evidenced a excellent outlook on Americans , the States  . We all have our issues be it UK or USA .

I will not lower myself into a posting about the sexes American v Englishman / women . That is childish and a posting a kid would submit .

Regarding the Royal Family ..we forget as a young nation , that the monarchy in  the British Isles represents a thousand years of continuity in the nations fiber and soul . Recall at the height of the Second World War  when UK was out gunned and it look as the island fortress may fall it was the Royal Family that stayed with their people . They understood a king , at the time of WW II  , if killed by the enemy  would not suppress liberty and freedom of Englishmen/women.

 The silent continuity of the monarchy that supported and defended the subjects would Burn deep in every Englishman's  heart  and surrender , if it came and thank God it did not , would only be face value ..and liberty and freedom would prevail .

Our system of Jurisprudence is based upon English Common law , not the Civil law of the Continent .....think of the gift given to the world and what it has done for our nation !!    

We may drive on different  sides of the road , but for the most part we are both as a nation , people and values drive on the same road !!! </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l3rw5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/27/world/europe/prince-harry/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T22:00:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T13:37:26+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/msowe2</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/27/world/europe/prince-harry/index.html#comment-478361592</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/aj69d</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
