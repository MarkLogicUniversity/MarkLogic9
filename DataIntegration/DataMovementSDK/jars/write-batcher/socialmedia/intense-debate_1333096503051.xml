Knowing self-defense, handgun rules state do not pull a gun on someone unless you intend to shoot. . . ..I'd be willing to bet Zimmerman didn't pull his gun, or he would have shot him earlier. Getting attacked from behind and knocked to the ground, having time to react and shoot your attacker as he is pummeling you and beating your head on the ground, you would be trying to deflect blows.

And I wouldn't be surprised if they won't find that there were powder Burns on Martin's chest, showing close quarter shooting. . .. ..which would suggest they were wrestling with the gun.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zalc3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t33k</id></website><link>http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/open-thread/blog-95/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T03:55:44+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:06:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3j2sa</id><link>http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/open-thread/blog-95/#comment-479951425</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/57oov</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
