And as public servant, he is opening himself to public scrutiny, public ridicule and public bashing. If he cannot take the Heat, he is  free to resign anytime. No one is stopping him except himself.

Furthermore, CJ Corona needs to understand that only he can Resolve the issue of trust by doing the following:

1) Open ALL your bank accounts, both peso and dollar;

2) Allow Supreme Court personnel to testify and;

3) Testify before the impeachment court so both Senator-Judges and the prosecution can asks questions relevant to his position as Chief Justice.

Because he continues to evade important issues against him, there is only one conviction here: GUILTY.

CORONA: I AM PREPARED TO LOSE EVERYTHING.

THE PEOPLE: YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE IF IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU STOLE EVERYTHING AND IT IS NOT YOURS TO BEGIN WITH.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rp3w2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q15f</id></website><link>http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/167627/corona-i%e2%80%99m-prepared-to-lose-everything</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T11:13:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:59:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk1kp7</id><link>http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/167627/corona-i%e2%80%99m-prepared-to-lose-everything#comment-476492307</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a3jhe</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
