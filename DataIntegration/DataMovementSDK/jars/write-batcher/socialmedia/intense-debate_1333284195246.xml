He was totally devastated because out of his 2 best friends (I was one) the other girl rejected him totally, and even told him 'he'll Burn in the flames of hell' for being gay. It was sad, we've known each other for more than 10 years and when that happened it really surprised me. I remember he was so scared that he even hesitated to tell me about it, because he thought I'd do the same.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/66ul2n</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/772v</id></website><link>http://webcomics.yaoi911.com/archive/artifice-page-87/</link><postedTime>2012-03-24T07:02:13+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T05:44:05+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwfogk</id><link>http://webcomics.yaoi911.com/archive/artifice-page-87/#comment-481573075</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dspml</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
