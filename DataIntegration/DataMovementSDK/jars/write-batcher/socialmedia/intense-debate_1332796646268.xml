Eden was badly advised and incompetent.

Blair was just inept... and used his greedy chancellor to debt fuel popularity purchasing measures.

I can find no good word for Callaghan.Â  He was mindbendingly incompetent and out of touch.Â  Like Brown he was a Chancellor who moved to PM.. That seems Always to have been a recipe for bad government.

I think these three tie for second place.Â  I vote for ryeatley's choice: Heath.Â  This treasonous weasel caused virtually every ill that has beset us since.Â  Sometimes he caused the problems simply because he invoked such a sense of hatred amongst his colleagues and opponents they would set out to spite him.
