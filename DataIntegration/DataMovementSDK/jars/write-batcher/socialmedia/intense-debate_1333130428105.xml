Has anyone ever listened to HIS rhetoric...Van Jones?  And as far as I know, that has NEVER been explained.  I've seen video of Valerie Jarret praising this ex-convict.  And yet this is a White House that is racially divisive, has a full compliment of radical, unvetted Czars on the payroll, which included the notorious communist Van Jones until Fox put the Heat on them.  

Hate talk against Palin is so lunatic it leaves you speechless. And yet the government will, by their deafening silence, condone it. 

No wonder they want to stamp out conservative talk shows and stations like Fox.  And yet it is alright to give tax payer dollars to ACORN and NPR, both which have a far left agenda.  Something is fishy.  And yet the Democrats will throw bombs at the Tea Party from this point on because one deranged young man committed a heinous Act. Who is more heinous??????</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/cznu0y</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/gabrielle-giffords/2011/01/09/tucson-shooter-and-violent-rhetoric-communist-manifesto</link><postedTime>2011-01-09T20:43:00+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-01-10T09:57:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/8cvqj8</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/gabrielle-giffords/2011/01/09/tucson-shooter-and-violent-rhetoric-communist-manifesto#comment-126743294</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8nldh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-01-09</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
