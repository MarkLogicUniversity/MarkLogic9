At night I work outside and they just sit there the entire time and watch me work. How do I know they're following me? They were smart enough to stalk me during the day just long enough for me to notice. If they initially started surveillance at night I never would've known. At night its harder to Spot them as they try to blend in with the stars. The only problem with their lights are too bright and I know the formation they use. At this point Im thinking they Always wanted me to know and they're just up there to mess with me. That being said Im sure you're not exaggerating. The joke's on me because I indirectly pay for their fuel...

There will probably be an officer or two respond and say that Im being totally absurd...
