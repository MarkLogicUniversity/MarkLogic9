Obama and the "progressive liberals" are just confused they think thier views trump everything regardless. 

That is called Fascism, and not seeing others views or even trying makes you the BIGOT 

Stop the BUSH OBAMA agenda they are taking our individual liberty, and destroying our constitution, the only thing we have to fight the government.

Educate your Bleeding hearts before you throw your vote behind these warmongers 

No Obama No romney,santorum 

Vote truth 
Vote liberty
Vote for our constitution
Vote for true equality 
Vote Ron Paul 2012
