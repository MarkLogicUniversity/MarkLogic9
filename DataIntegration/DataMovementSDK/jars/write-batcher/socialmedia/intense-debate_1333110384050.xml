Views about other cultures of people passed down from generation to generation.Â  In this case, too many times, the person of color has to 'prove' that he/she is a good person before not being treated to racial indifference and/or the Cold treatment.Â  

The above are generally speaking but do not apply to every single person within the respective cultures.

Long story short: Zim, Lopez is Hispanic (probably of Mexican origin) and he wanted to be White because his step-father is white.Â  If his crimes were hate crimes, then they were the actions of a Hispanic racist person who wanted to be of the White racist variety - an Uncle Tom.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ybcfy</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ydw9</id></website><link>http://motherjones.com/node/168681</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T16:19:16+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T06:46:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/ms1hub</id><link>http://motherjones.com/node/168681#comment-478148386</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zlpcm</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
