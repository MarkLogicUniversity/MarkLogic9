You say we&amp;#039;re not sycophants, which I don&amp;#039;t contest, but I don&amp;#039;t think NOT insulting someone&amp;#039;s intelligence because they were rude, qualifies you as a sheep. In fact I think the opposite is true, and the opposite happened. I think a lot of sheep, or lemmings, if you will, followed the leader Off the cliff. Now I want to link to a site I frequent for its guest list updates and its often interesting discussions: The Activity Pit.&#13;

This is the discussion about the episode that sparked the podcast. Of all the negative comments about McEnany, how many are blatant and don&amp;#039;t give a reason? All of about one or two. I get that on Twitter it&amp;#039;s tough to get a cogent critique of something someone said into a tweet, but you only see a couple rude negative comments. I wish the guys read the Pit more often! Maybe they do but they don&amp;#039;t talk about it because, as you say (here I plug one of your points!), they focus on the negative which they can easy find on Twitter. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:323728:127798188</id><idPostId>127798188</idPostId><idBlogId>323728</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:323728</id><idBlogId>323728</idBlogId><link>http://www.chrisisright.net</link><displayName>Chris Is RIGHT</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.chrisisright.net/2011/06/29/red-eye-in-which-i-get-off-the-short-bus/</link><displayName>Red Eye: In Which I Get Off The Short Bus</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-07-08T14:31:47.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:323728:127798188:327570497</id><link>http://www.chrisisright.net/2011/06/29/red-eye-in-which-i-get-off-the-short-bus/#IDComment327570497</link><postedTime>2011-07-08T14:31:47.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Red Eye: In Which I Get Off The Short Bus by TomGMS</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://twitter.com/TomGMS</link><idEmailMd5>aaa0b4463622ae706036118057dd6eaf</idEmailMd5><displayName>TomGMS</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/TomGMS"&gt;TomGMS&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://www.chrisisright.net/2011/06/29/red-eye-in-which-i-get-off-the-short-bus/"&gt;Red Eye: In Which I Get Off The Short Bus&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2011-07-08</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
