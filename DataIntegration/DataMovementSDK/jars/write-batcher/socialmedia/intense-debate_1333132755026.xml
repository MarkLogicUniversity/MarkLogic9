There is no evidence of self-defense. There is no evidence on either Trayvon's body or on Zimmerman of a fight. Zimmerman conveniently noticed his broken nose the next day which means he could have given it to himself once he got home. Do you Always make a point of saying that teens who get murdered deserve what they got? How sick and creepy is that? Would you want someone to say that about your children? You need help. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zcxr4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:16:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T06:46:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m30mcf</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-480332725</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzj42</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
