The only thing they could do is give people like this woman a brain transplant as hers is clearly faulty.
I could not believe the stupid question she had just asked as this was the Act of a stupid woman who at forty is old enough to know better.
Petrol in a confined space and a lighted cookerÂ is bordering on insanity and it is a wonder she did not Burn the house down.
Trying to blame the government for this accident is a bit rich even for Ed Balls and the labour party.
This was down to blinding ignorance and there is little or nothing any government can do with people like that.
People who want to blame the government for what happened are the types who are totally unable to think for themselves.
