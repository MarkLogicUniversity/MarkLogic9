That includes thin people.Â  The folks you see out running, walking, biking aren't Always wanting to do those activitiesÂ but it's done because it needs to be done to avoid health issues.Â  
Start with small steps.Â  Nothing worth achieving (better health) is easy.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67xhtd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/31/living/fatshion-beauty-bloggers/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T04:07:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:21:08+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mws8hm</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/31/living/fatshion-beauty-bloggers/index.html#comment-481866235</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/r656m</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
