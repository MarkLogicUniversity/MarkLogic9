They are too busy staring at their shining object saying Look How much prettier mine is than yours! They want us to be jealous because we can't afford one? BS...the rest of us simply choose a superior product because we don't feel the need to conform, we actually have a choice as to what we get to purchase rather than having the almighty Apple choose for us. How does their catch phrase go? Think different.....And Be Exactly Like Everyone Else!!!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zq5zz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/nw4s</id></website><link>http://betanews.com/2012/03/29/iphone-is-unstoppable/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:37:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:53:28+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31ewi</id><link>http://betanews.com/2012/03/29/iphone-is-unstoppable/#comment-479819334</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rcvfs</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
