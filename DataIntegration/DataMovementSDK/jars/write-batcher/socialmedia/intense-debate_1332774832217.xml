Could it be that elements of the Justice Department sugested the New Black Panther Party do  the lynch mob thing?

They are in fact in clear violation of the law, with these wanted dead or alive posters, furthermore; from my
understanding Mr. Zimmerman's face is on these posters, who supplied the pictures ?
They are inciting an Act of violence and also targeted assassination, that is called conspiracy to commit murder.

These same elements with in the Justice Department are up to there eye balls in another murderous scandle
project Fast and Furious in which at least 213 people were gunned down in Cold blood, and these same people including Mr. Eric Holder has told the Congress to go screw its self and refuse to cooperate
in the congressional investigation, one letter that to do with project fast and furious
was allowed to be with drawn, because it was full of lies.

Thus how can we trust the Justice Department to be impartial in their investigation into this matter?
when there is corrupt political leadership at the top?
