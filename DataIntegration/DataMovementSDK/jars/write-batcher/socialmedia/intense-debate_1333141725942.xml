They write  their losses, passing Off the costs to the taxpayers, premium payers, and paying customers.  As an ER veterinarian, I deal with inability to pay all the time.  It is a Cold hard fact of life.  I have "wiggle room" to try to make things happen for life threatening emergencies, but this is at the discretion of my boss.  Maybe one day, I will have the luxury of driving a business of my own into the ground with a squeaky clean conscience.  Till then, I'm gonna save up for the beamer....wink, wink.
And btw, I consider my pets part of my family.  I would beg, borrow, and steal (yah...I'd rob you) to treat even minor ailments in them.  I would not make it your problem....other than the robbing.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/dia1cl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/bhxi</id></website><link>http://www.askavetquestion.com/why-are-vets-so-expensive.php</link><postedTime>2012-01-10T19:52:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T08:52:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwcvst</id><link>http://www.askavetquestion.com/why-are-vets-so-expensive.php#comment-480532049</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-01-10</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
