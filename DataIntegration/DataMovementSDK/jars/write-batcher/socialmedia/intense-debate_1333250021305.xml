In 1976 The riots started the night before, "with Israeli-Arabs throwing rocks and firebombs at police and soldiers. The riots continued the next day and intensified, resulting in many wounded members of Israeli security forces and the death of the six Arab rioters."[26] 

Yosef Goell, writing in The Jerusalem Post, says that, "What actually set Off the rioting that led to the deaths was a wild attack by hundreds of inflamed young Arabs on an unsuspecting IDF convoy driving on the road by the villages of Sakhnin, Arrabe and Deir Hanna. There was no prior provocation on the part of that IDF convoy, unless one insists on seeing a provocation in the very presence of an Israeli army unit in the heart of Israeli Galilee."[27]

A 2003 Israeli government document notes that, "Arab public figures tried to limit the protests, but lost control over the events. The protestors Burnt tires, blocked roads, and threw rocks and molotov cocktails." </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67ymxe</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/h8a5</id></website><link>http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2012/03/201233016368704474.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:14:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:44:44+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwnqwa</id><link>http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2012/03/201233016368704474.html#comment-481329145</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/w2wt</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
