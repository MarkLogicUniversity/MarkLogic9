The #1 Spot held by a blog which is self described as "leftist, very leftist" and my closest competitor self describes as a "Hippie Liberal" from Texas. You can vote for all of the conservatives at the list every 24 hours through April 4th - unless you want openly socialist radical feminists to win, and they are currently winning BTW. So vote for us, please, if you think vaginas are more than just Joy toys and you recognize that it's OK for live babies to come out of them! And remember what the typical bitter, angry, man hating leftist looks like in comparison to Conservative women, who are not filled with bitter hatred towards men and children and are generally much happier and more loving people. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6772w9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6v5j</id></website><link>http://theothermccain.com/2012/03/30/shocking-republican-sex-scandals/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T21:50:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T11:40:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwpot4</id><link>http://theothermccain.com/2012/03/30/shocking-republican-sex-scandals/#comment-481760118</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cvmas</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
