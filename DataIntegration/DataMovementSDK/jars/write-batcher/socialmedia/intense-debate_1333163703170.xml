at the start of the season no one would have imagined this team getting Off to the start they did at least i didnt.
they led the league in blocked shots (what goalie wouldnt do well) and played with heart and confidance.
where did this team go?
dion is looking very tired and disorganized at best and schenn keeps giveing puck away.
i suggest Burke be canned, Phaneuf be traded and we seach for a goalie that can stand on his head because we have no defense.
i keep saying give them a couple years to gel as a team but dont think that is what this team truely needs.
I Bleed blue and white but this is nuts
Carlyle is not the answer but wish him well with this group
