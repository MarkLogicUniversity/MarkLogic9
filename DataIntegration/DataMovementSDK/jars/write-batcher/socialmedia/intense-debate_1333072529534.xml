It isnt fair to loudly preach to people who dont want to hear what you have to say and are just going about their daily business. What if someone one had to make a call quietly and didnt want to lose their Spot? This idiot was just looking for a crowd to preach to and he should have left when the security guard asked him to. He was just causing problems. If he wanted to have people listen to him he should have handed out fliers and bible tracks and invited them to his church or event. There is 100% no harm in that and people dont have to take them if they dont want them. That way he wouldn't annoy people and turned them Off from Christianity further.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zh26v</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/29/taking-liberties-arrested-for-reading-bible/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:06:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:22:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3bgab</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/29/taking-liberties-arrested-for-reading-bible/#comment-479723530</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5dj20</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
