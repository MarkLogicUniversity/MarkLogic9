Black guy is on top of him beating him in the face and he is screaming for help and then he shoots him, according to the ONLY witness (not the two lesbians whoÂ saw nothing until the fight was over).. 

If your little black hero is running away, how come there is no bullet wound in this back, but Zimmie has grass stains on HIS back, a broken nose and is Bleeding in the back of his head?

You people don't want a grand jury. Because like the police and the state attorney, they aren't gonna charge someone because the deceased is black. And that is all that you want. 

You are gonna whine 'racist' until some white guy is punished. You dont care who. I remember how disappointed you all were when it was discovered the shooter was Hispanic...</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yufxu</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/8nmh</id></website><link>http://clickorlando.preview.ib-prod.com/pns/servlet/page/view/pns-orlpn/news/-/1637132/9671616/-/u6xkmd/-/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:38:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T21:59:14+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mimzpj</id><link>http://clickorlando.preview.ib-prod.com/pns/servlet/page/view/pns-orlpn/news/-/1637132/9671616/-/u6xkmd/-/index.html#comment-473997519</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gams0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
