However Vince and creative are to blame. They have John Cena but as the top face of the company he is a failure. 50/50 Split during live shows says it all. They had a chance with CM Punk but they blew it. Randy Orton doesn't have what it takes to be the top guy in the company. They have no faith in the younger talent. Dolph Ziggler, Cody Rhodes and more they just don't have the faith in these young talents to push them to the moon.

The thing to me is back when the attitude Era was kicking while you had Stone Cold and The Rock as the main baby faces they had a equal heels to go against. Triple H love him or hate him he was a damn good effective heel. In my opinion one of the best of all time. He was extremely hated and did his job well. Kurt Angle was another impressive heel. The Rock and Stone Cold had their heels that made them look even better because those heels were hated so much. Who now in the WWE is a dominate heel??? Go ahead and answer I'll wait... Their are no dominate heels

Stone Cold and The Rock were more believable and easier to get behind because they weren't superman they would lose matches against the dominate heels. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zoti8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/e1x9</id></website><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0329/551209/the-rock/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:47:23+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:17:45+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3smth</id><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0329/551209/the-rock/#comment-480193249</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5rr3c</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
