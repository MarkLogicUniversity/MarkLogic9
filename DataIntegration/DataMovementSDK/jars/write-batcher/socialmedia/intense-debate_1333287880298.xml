It may have seemed a wonderful Wheeze to use a potential strike, which had not actually been announced, as a stick with which to beat Labour, but no-one had the basic nous to realise what would happen as soon as government ministers went on the airwaves to say, "don't panic, but ...". 

Cameron was airlifted into PR from on high, so may not understand it too well, but surely spmeone somewhere in the Tory Party has some knowledge of how it works. Something they may want to consider is that everyone already knows Labour is funded by the unions. It's not a Secret. Trying to draw attention to that in order to deflect the electorates gaze from an unpopular budget is fifth form stuff, not even worthy of the university debating club.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67tiqn</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xps8</id></website><link>http://www7.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2012/03/31/marf-after-a-day-dominated-by-george/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T00:41:37+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T06:48:00+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw9ln9</id><link>http://www7.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2012/03/31/marf-after-a-day-dominated-by-george/#comment-481599530</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6crm0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
