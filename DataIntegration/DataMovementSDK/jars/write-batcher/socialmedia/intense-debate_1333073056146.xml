Itâ€™s all so sudden. Nobody remembers how old Humphrey is now, but he is ace with a difficult birth. Last night there was a still born lamb which he just whooshed up in his shovel hands, and when he rubbed its chest with straw, death slunk away. The lamb is running around now with the sun on its skinny back, shaking its tail and Shouting. Another lifeless one had its mouth held shut while Humphrey
breathed into its nose, now thatâ€™s skipping about, too. Humphrey told me it would soon `be a bright Cold day in April, and the clocks will strike thirteen,â€™ so I guess heâ€™s been on the cider again and his breath would waken Grendelâ€™s mother. Dog was `born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world is mad,â€™ so he is pleased to meet
you too, Ant .</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hrzk1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ms5w</id></website><link>http://my.telegraph.co.uk/theshortstoryclub/louiseatmyt/205/a-postcard-from/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T11:40:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:29:23+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3b6pm</id><link>http://my.telegraph.co.uk/theshortstoryclub/louiseatmyt/205/a-postcard-from/#comment-479731003</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8glx7</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
