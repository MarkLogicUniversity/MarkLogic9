I can eat lunch in 10-15 minutes &amp; I'm small enough to just lean my seat back &amp; put up my feet (the Joys of being petite). I just took a 15-minute nap today, in fact. I think 20-30 minutes would be more ideal though. I've also gone for short runs this past winter during my lunch (about 2 miles) and that I think leaves me more invigorated and energized to finish the afternoon well. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zmhs5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dx2</id></website><link>http://michaelhyatt.com/why-you-should-take-a-nap-every-day.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T09:04:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:07:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m314mm</id><link>http://michaelhyatt.com/why-you-should-take-a-nap-every-day.html#comment-479833891</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ucbn</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
