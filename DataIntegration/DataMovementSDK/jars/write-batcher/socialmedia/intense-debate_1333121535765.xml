If a human stool was Heated, spun and treated would you be ok with it being added to your food just because no one could find any risk?

I have no problem with anyone that wants to eat it by the Slice but I object that it is hidden in school lunches without proper disclosure. Â I have no doubt that anyone knowing the difference would buy the slime free beef for their personalÂ consumption.

If the burger was the same price would you prefer it not to have slime or do you not care at all?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lj4f0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/v3kr</id></website><link>http://healthland.time.com/2012/03/27/pink-slime-maker-cuts-back-production-is-that-a-good-thing/</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T17:32:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T00:14:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/msqxlo</id><link>http://healthland.time.com/2012/03/27/pink-slime-maker-cuts-back-production-is-that-a-good-thing/#comment-477925084</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/sqow</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
