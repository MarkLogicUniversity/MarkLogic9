He's anti-Blah people; he's legislatively unprincipled; he has pretty much the same view of women that wingers accuse Islam of having; &amp; he wants to repeal of separation of church - his personally-approved version of church, being northwest European post Neandertal Catholic as re-formed by Jean Chauvin (a.k.a. Calvinism, akin to the American variation of Puritanism that led to Burning women as witches &amp; forcing them to wear scarlet "A"s) &amp; state.
