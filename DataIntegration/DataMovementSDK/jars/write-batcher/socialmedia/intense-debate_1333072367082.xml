You either become wise from it or die from it. The analogy Off peeing your pants on a Cold night is as down to earth as you can get. Rest assured there are deniers of that as well. Ask any lefty. They either have a hot tub to get in or a shelter run by good Christians to warm and clean them. Now they want uncle Sam to do it so they can hide from God. because they already know that they can't get a free hot tub and drugs at the same time.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ztlor</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/f7e3</id></website><link>http://www.wnd.com/2012/03/megadeth-frontman-obama-not-born-in-u-s/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:18:25+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:20:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3bc7o</id><link>http://www.wnd.com/2012/03/megadeth-frontman-obama-not-born-in-u-s/#comment-479721448</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/mn8uj</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
