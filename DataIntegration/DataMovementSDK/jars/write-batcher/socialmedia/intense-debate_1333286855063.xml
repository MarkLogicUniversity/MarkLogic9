Has Trickster got so greedy until they can't even give us at least 5K when we worked our butts Off and leaving our computer on just for auto-drilling? When reality is that we are risking our computer by leaving it on for days and letting our computers Burn! We deserve more than just 3K MyShop Points and some items which are just useful to use just for a period of time. As a fellow Trickster player, we should voice our opinion and just as Dowallem said " WE DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS."</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ywj0o0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/h3tc</id></website><link>http://trickster.gamerage.com/poppuri/</link><postedTime>2012-03-07T23:11:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T06:43:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw96xd</id><link>http://trickster.gamerage.com/poppuri/#comment-481596956</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7x3w</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-07</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
