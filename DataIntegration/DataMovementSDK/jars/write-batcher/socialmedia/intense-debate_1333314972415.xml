They were not perfect -- ie, we did retain slavery in the US for along time-- but eventually the general historic trend was progressively  toward the betterment of all, even though things we slow and this policy was not Always honored beyond some borders.  This has now reversed.  In time, we are returning to extreme feudal times:  what is the point of "freedom" and "liberty"  if there is no health[care] or a living wage to enjoy it.  Freedom is Cold and does not feed you.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67yjo8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tsjl</id></website><link>http://truth-out.org/news/item/8217-the-corporations-bankrolling-alec-which-has-promoted-the-stand-your-ground-gun-law-as-a-model-bill</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:40:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:48:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwstfg</id><link>http://truth-out.org/news/item/8217-the-corporations-bankrolling-alec-which-has-promoted-the-stand-your-ground-gun-law-as-a-model-bill#comment-481886105</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5fvf4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
