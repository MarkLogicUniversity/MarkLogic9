Things Our "Flexible" President May Do When He Is Re-elected

Barack Hussein Obama is so cocksure of re-election that he is making plans for 2013-2016.  
Obama made that surety obvious when he pulled yet another gaffe in South Korea by not realizing he was speaking with a hot mike as he whispered to the outgoing Russian figurehead President Dmitry Medvedev. 
The surreptitious exchange: 
Obama: On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved but it’s important for him to give me space.
Medvedev: Yeah, I understand. I understand your message about space. Space for you…
Obama: ( over and putting his hand on Mr. Medvedev’s knee): This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility.
Medvedev: I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir.
America’s commander-in-chief essentially promised to give away America’s European missile defense  to Russia after he wins in November, that he would share vital, military information with the incoming Russian fraudulent President Vladimir Putin since he will have fooled the American electorate once again. 
That treasonous plot with the nation against which we waged a decades-long Cold War and which Mitt Romney called America’s “number one geopolitical foe” has raised suspicions on what else Obama has hidden up his sleeve, as if outright presidential treason were not enough.   
Based on the president’s words and actions over the past four years, here are some educated guesses on what Americans can expect by 2016 or sooner should he win four more years to perpetrate more treason, wreak havoc with our economy, undermine our international standing, and convert the country into a Third World nation: 
.  Israel will be abandoned despite Obama’s  to the contrary, Venezuela will become a trusted ally, and the 50 year old sanctions against Cuba will be lifted.  (Obama and his administration have frequently demonstrated an antipathy to Israel and an affinity for all things Islamic, have indicated they want Hugo Chavez to be a buddy, and have a special affection for Communism.)  
.  The United Nations will be recognized as the preeminent authority to dictate America’s foreign and domestic policy.  (Obama is a professed “One-Worlder” who sees the U.N. as the one organization capable of insuring peace and tranquility throughout the planet.)  
 .  Attorney General Eric Holder’s racist and corrupt DoJ will continue to mete out justice predicated on how it can benefit African-Americans and how it discriminates against caucasians.  (Holder has called whites “cowards” and has frequently used the Justice Department to advance the cause of black agitators and anarchists such as the New Black Panther Party.)  
.  The United States Constitution will be described as antiquated, out-of-touch, and relegated to the National Archives.  (Obama has often ignored and violated constitutional mandates and proscriptions and like-minded Associate Justice Ginsburg recently demeaned that precious document.)  
.  Gasoline prices will rise to and beyond European levels of $8 to $10 a gallon.  (Obama’s Energy Secretary Steven Chu has expressed that wish which will force Americans to drive tiny death traps, bicycle to work, Shiver in their homes, and be laid Off by employers unable to function in 50 degree temperatures.)  
.  Coal mines and electricity-generating coal plants will close en masse, astronomically raising the costs of energy.  (Obama vowed to do just that in the 2008 campaign when he vowed to make coal so expensive that it would bankrupt the coal industry.)   
.  The Environmental Protection Agency will become the most powerful force in American life, choking to death all industries–save solar and similar enterprises–with mindless regulations.  (The EPA has already crippled any number of economic initiatives as the president endorses and wastes billions of taxpayer dollars on “green” failures like Solyndra.)  
.  Oil exploration will virtually cease to satisfy environmentalists even as the cessation caused extreme hardships on the oil industry, its workers, and the American people.  (The horrendous BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico enabled Obama to use it as excuse to suspend deep-sea exploration, reinforce his opposition to drilling in ANWR, and preach about the glories of biofuels despite the fact they have driven up the cost of corn and many other food products and are far less efficient than gasoline.) 
There is a whole host of repercussions awaiting Americans if Barack Hussein Obama’s arrogant presumption that he is a shoo-in for re-election comes to fruition. 
In addition to the above, we can expect Obama’s Uncle Omar–and the U.N.–to be allowed to reside in the United States despite Uncle Omar’s  status as an illegal alien for 19 years.  We can expect renewed efforts to re-institute the grossly-unfair Fairness Doctrine to silence conservative talk radio.  Not beyond possibility is a push to nominate Sandra Fluke as ambassador at large and to posthumously name the Florida teen thug, Trayvon Martin, as a candidate for Mount Rushmore.. 
Barack Hussein Obama isn’t the devil incarnate or the anti-Christ, but he’s close.
