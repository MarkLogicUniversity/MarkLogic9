Have you not gotten the memo that a bit more supply generated from the US is not going to alter the global oil price. Did you know that the US gov doesn't have oil refineries. That means that any oil found will essentially be the property of the oil company that has a lease on that well. There are no provisions for the oil companies to stop importing our oil abroad, where they are getting a much better price. I don't understand where you get these notions. If the Off shore oil operations are getting Heat from the EPA, it's their own fault. they put themselves in the Spot light by letting that oil spill in the gulf occur by no other reason than their own ineptitude. I could go on but there is no point. You go do your obama hate thing...its not relevant.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zgmpt</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ant8</id></website><link>http://www.alternet.org/news/154724/why_the_right%27s_zombie_lie_about_gas_prices_is_wrong_but_they%27ll_never_let_it_die/comments/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T07:41:37+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:16:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31fvs</id><link>http://www.alternet.org/news/154724/why_the_right%27s_zombie_lie_about_gas_prices_is_wrong_but_they%27ll_never_let_it_die/comments/#comment-479843312</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c30uv</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
