I'll read your article. I'm actually reading that Quiet book now. I do understand that some people get energy from being around others, but even extroverts have to put their head down and work. No one pays for people to talk, unless your a speaker or a phone rep. I "cowork" a lot with friends, and I love being with them. But, I only do it with the ones I know won't distract me. Many of them are extroverts, but they also believe in doing real work. I can't do coworking Spots because I can't control who I'll be working with and Ensure they have my same dedication to getting work done.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hzf77</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/b8il</id></website><link>http://brianburridge.com/2012/03/28/the-coworking-challenge/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T14:18:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:24:21+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31sye</id><link>http://brianburridge.com/2012/03/28/the-coworking-challenge/#comment-479852106</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/iwut</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
