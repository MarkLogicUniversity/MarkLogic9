I played it for 2 or 3 years in the usual garage band scene â€“ at that age I didnâ€™t even know what I had.
Then I did one of the stupidest things in my life. I transitioned into more acoustic music of the late 60â€™sÂ  and traded the beautiful cherry ES-335 for some crappy acoustic guitar; I donâ€™t even remember what it was; it doesnâ€™t matter anymore anyway. 
I regretted that for 40 years. After many more guitars and years I decided to try and get my 1963 ES-335 back again.
After looking and looking in the used market I just couldnâ€™t find the right one â€“ they all had the â€œtracksâ€&#157; of who knows how many other players on them and just didnâ€™t feel right.
I ordered the 1963 ES-335 Block Reissue in cherry thru Gibson Custom exactly as I remembered it when I was 13. I even went thru my parentsâ€™ old photo albums to help refresh my memory.
Iâ€™ve had it for about 6 months now. I guess you would have to call it a midlife crisis or something.
It wasnâ€™t cheap, but it plays, feels and sounds exactly the way I remember it did back in the 60â€™s â€“ what an absolute Joy!
This wonderful guitar will have to be pried from my Cold dead hands this time.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/84py73</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6yb5</id></website><link>http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/ES/Gibson-Custom/1963-ES-335-Block.aspx</link><postedTime>2010-10-07T07:29:57+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-01-26T16:08:36+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/ew3tov</id><link>http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/ES/Gibson-Custom/1963-ES-335-Block.aspx#comment-421466704</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lkrhb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2010-10-07</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
