This question is a little tough because I think all are important together. Emotional intensity will probably have to be the top because there has to be a sense of intensity and urgency for me to get the characters together, to the point where they would change for each other or do anything/sacrafice anything to be together.Â  
Then I like a little humor.Â  It doesn't have to be a riot, laugh every page but humor placed in perfect Spots to break up all that intense emotion.Â  You don't want to be completely drained or a wreck when you read lolÂ Â  I think humor can go along with witty banter, which is a must for me.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zc9ch</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/oleu</id></website><link>http://www.eliserome.com/mm-historical/2012/3/29/329-sherry-thomas-interview-giveaway.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:25:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:56:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31y5m</id><link>http://www.eliserome.com/mm-historical/2012/3/29/329-sherry-thomas-interview-giveaway.html#comment-479822119</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
