She was on Purina Pro when we got her from the shelter and switched to 4Health Large Breed nearly 3 weeks ago. The transition was tough on her stomach- gas and Diarrhea for a couple days but now we've seen a huge difference. Her coat is the biggest thing- shiny, rich in color, and not shedding like she was before. Her bowels also seem to be more consistent and her energy level is improved. Can't say enough good things!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/mubw3w</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ukja</id></website><link>http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/4health-dog-food-dry/</link><postedTime>2011-11-05T23:00:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T01:15:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miy36l</id><link>http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/4health-dog-food-dry/#comment-474114756</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-11-05</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
