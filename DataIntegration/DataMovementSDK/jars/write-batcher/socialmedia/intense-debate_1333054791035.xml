Eveland- Passes through waivers to AAA, wouldn't be a big loss anyway.
Tillman- Norfolk bound, he has more value to the club as a starter then reliever.
Phillips- Norfolk, he'll be one of the first back on the major league club.
Simon- Would NOT make it through waivers, either trade him or DL.
Strop- Would NOT make it through waivers, he makes the team.
Patton- Also wouldn't make it through waivers, makes the team.
O'Day- Tough call, hope he isn't the odd man out because of Gregg.
Wada- They can be flexible with him, extended spring, Norfolk, DL, or 5th rotation Spot.
Matusz-  on what happens with Wada, probably makes the club though.

I really wish they would just dump Gregg.  It seems like he would be one of those players that would Bounce back really well though after getting cut.  Also I believe this is a contract year for him so i suppose the motivation is there...  Regardless, he stinks now, and he stunk all last year.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z6e51</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/z6fr</id></website><link>http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2012/03/sarasota-fla---the-orioles.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T11:41:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:18:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3tpjk</id><link>http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2012/03/sarasota-fla---the-orioles.html#comment-479522299</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/l2y2g</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
