The guy wants to be president of the United States and he can't even get Off the ground to do so. He wasn't on  time to be able to qualify, his platform on issues has more holes that what  Richardson had, he's a Cry baby because he wasn't part of the debate; well  he had nothing to offer. He still want to be a candidate when no one is  paying any attention to him. When he was governor of New Mexico he ran the state  like a business and not careing for the needs of New Mexicans. He's the only  governor in New Mexico that vetoed the most bill in history and YOU'RE BEHIND  HIM!!!! You're a loser from the get go! Face realty! I'm a Republican and I won't vote for him. He would have been an embarrassment to New Mexicans as was Richardson who was at the bottom of  the pole!
