That said, I do not in any way deny people their civil rights to be who they are, dress the way they will, listen to whatever they call music, or practice whatever religion they so choose.Â  If they find that slop served at an Americanized Chinese buffet palatable instead of real Chinese food - have at it.

So, amconservative, I would say "get over it."Â  Unless they are scaring the horses, this is a free country.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lp3qj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dngw</id></website><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/27/opinion/wednesday-march-28-2012-gay-marriage-the-labor-mural-and-cremation/</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T19:22:40+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T10:14:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/ms95q8</id><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/27/opinion/wednesday-march-28-2012-gay-marriage-the-labor-mural-and-cremation/#comment-478229870</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/u6nm</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
