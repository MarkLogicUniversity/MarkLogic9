I really considered dropping ubuntu on all my clients machines that I manage and have installed 10.04 for them with the promise of years long stability. As Unity loomed along with no alternatives I really started panicking, because the reliable OS that 10.0.4 is suddenly seemed to have turned into a nightmare with the releases after.Â  Unity would be not only a shock but in professional areas simply make ubuntu unusable, especially for graphic designers and photographers .Â Â  At home Unity and its one window UI is ok, fun and might be your taste , even I do not completely despise it - but ubuntu is used in situations where a lot of open windows and accesible menus are simply a must have standard. So Glad to hear this, it takes my Headaches away and lets me look forward again ;-)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6d0dkt</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/cpho</id></website><link>http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/?p=53670</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T19:08:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:50:26+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mig2uk</id><link>http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/?p=53670#comment-473885851</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6yqhj</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
