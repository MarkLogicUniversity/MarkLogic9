However, it was poorly presented and that is not the impression that pensioners will have. I will say that Mr Miliband was surprisingly effective and Mr Osborne less so, not so much at the despatch box as in his interviews subsequently. It seems to me that pensioners have no way of influencing their future income. They can't work harder or change jobs. Increasingly they cannot influence their expenditure either, and it is this sense of being at the mercy of food, fuel and tax that must be difficult to cope with. One does not have to be a Bleeding heart liberal to see that Ensuring that our older generation have at least some discretionary income would reduce Anxiety and provide a small buffer. Yes, times are hard; yes, we must all lower our standard of living; no, it does not appear fair if those who have done their bit for this country are squeezed so hard.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yh123</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ms5i</id></website><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/normantebbit/100146023/budget-2012-george-osborne-has-hurt-the-elderly-and-failed-to-address-the-deficit/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T08:55:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T11:01:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mpsuk1</id><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/normantebbit/100146023/budget-2012-george-osborne-has-hurt-the-elderly-and-failed-to-address-the-deficit/#comment-473496036</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/81ick</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
