I must have killed the refresh button so many times in order to see if the comments board had been activated :D but now, they're finally up! COMMENTS ALIIIVE! XD

Seriously, it Burns writing on here, like when someone who hasn't been in the light for quite some time comes out of the dark and into the light, and it hurts. :D But I am very pleased that it's back on, and I'm happy that Doctor Who TV replied to my email asking what was going on. Thank you for doing that :)
