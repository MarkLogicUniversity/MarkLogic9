John Fowler, see below, Spot on the Pasty originates from Cornwall and was a staple meal for the tin miners. Â The Pasty industry is a multi million pound business and if the tax goes through will have a massive effect to many business's in the Westcounty. Â If the cost increases, turnover will reduce causing untold unemployment. There are many petitions doing the rounds and Â i would urge all of you to sign and say NO to the Pasty Tax.Another piece of information for you Amol is the Pasty was originally known as the Tiddyoggy, hence the chant at sporting events Oggy Oggy Oggy!!Â For your records i had a pasty last Thursday and as they say down our way twas blimmin ansome. Sugggest you try one yourself.KERNOW for ever.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zdljf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mxv6</id></website><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/amol-rajan-pastygate-is-exposing-osbornes-difference-from-us-all-7600036.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T09:57:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:00:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3fu36</id><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/amol-rajan-pastygate-is-exposing-osbornes-difference-from-us-all-7600036.html#comment-479887966</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zztlh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
