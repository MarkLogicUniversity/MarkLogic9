So now the weather IS proof of global warming, but when it was unseasonably Cold all summer two years ago, it wasn't?Â Â  You're such a devote believer.Â Â  

For anyone with more than 2 braincells to rub together they might have noticed the unpresidented solar activity recently that was so powerful the Aurora Borealis was visable further south than ever before and aircraft had to be re-routed for safety and think, hey maybe the great big ball of fire in the sky has something to do with this record warm spell.Â  

But believers like Crickmore just know that a harmless gas, a plant food that is necessary for all life on Earth just has to be the problem even if we have to discard the science to "prove" it.

Usefull idiots like Crickmore think a politician who understands the difference between realÂ science and Marxist theology disquised as science is a "fool".Â  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yx84e</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6z74</id></website><link>http://wizbangblog.com/2012/03/22/dear-conservatives-romney-isnt-one-of-us-but-we-still-hold-the-power-if/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T15:31:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:10:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi8rai</id><link>http://wizbangblog.com/2012/03/22/dear-conservatives-romney-isnt-one-of-us-but-we-still-hold-the-power-if/#comment-473759346</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/da6jt</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
