I think he handled himself fine in some other Spots but asking Toure his opinion was not one of them. You can't solicit a person's opinion then knock them for having an opinion. There is a difference between having an opinion and trying and convicting someone. Tim Russert had opinions. You just didn't know them. He would have been better Off arguing that Toure should not make his opinion known if he wants to be impartial. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67qcft</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tz1k</id></website><link>http://www.mediaite.com/tv/piers-morgan-and-toure-finish-their-twitter-feud-on-cnns-air/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:02:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:53:22+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwu7uu</id><link>http://www.mediaite.com/tv/piers-morgan-and-toure-finish-their-twitter-feud-on-cnns-air/#comment-481463555</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dt5hy</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
