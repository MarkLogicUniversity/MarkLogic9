Mathews is dependably repulsive. I mean, that is the one thing you can Depend on. And I can't bear it when his slobbery sputum flies uncontrollably out of his mouth and slimes the TV camera. The poor cameramen assigned to this vile 'show' must have to wear rain slickers to protect themselves from the viscous spray that Mathews hurls out of his blathering pie hole. He is a totally irrelevant loud mouth and his Tingling legasm's at the mere mention of Obama's name are too lurid to watch without losing the lunch. Really, watching Mathews fawn and verbally paw his 'idol' and lefty love interest, Obama, is just too X Rated for the family hour. Who cares what this idiot has to say anyway? 

MSNBC is nothing less than State Television, a.k.a., ObamaVision. The perfect compliment to NPR. MSNBC is so awful, they really need to consider some new programming to 'fluff up'. How about: 'Liberally Speaking With Bertha Lewis'? I really miss tearing into Bertha.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/cv1594</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/birthers/2011/01/14/birthers-usually-some-cracker-right-says-nbc-anchor</link><postedTime>2011-01-14T23:40:54+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-01-15T05:39:37+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/850f93</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/birthers/2011/01/14/birthers-usually-some-cracker-right-says-nbc-anchor#comment-129317145</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8nldh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-01-14</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
