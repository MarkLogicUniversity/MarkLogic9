Who has stoked the story?  Why surprise, surprise it's the Tories!  Here we have an attempted double hit from the Tories - divert attention from a scandal plus a Spot of Union bashing at the same time.  Spin or what?

Of course the medium of television news has jumped on the band wagon (yes, it seems to have plenty of fuel).  Why doesn't the TV news show petrol stations with plenty of fuel and no queues?  I have driven past my local petrol stations and they have fuel, no queues and no TV news cameras.  Of course good news is no news as far as they are concerned.

Remember folks, it is a threatened strike.  The Union has to give seven days notice before the strike which will give us all plenty of time to Act like Corporal Jones - don't panic, don't panic!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h0xwd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/za8b</id></website><link>http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/cameron-under-fire-as-country-rushes-to-fill-up.17119530</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T02:06:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T11:07:48+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m37t43</id><link>http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/cameron-under-fire-as-country-rushes-to-fill-up.17119530#comment-479413113</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/y4qgi</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
