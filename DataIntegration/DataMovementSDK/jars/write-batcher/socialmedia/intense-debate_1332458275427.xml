While I'm not a fan of Sith being Republic, I think the legacy system will be kind of nice and at least different from every other game out there. The abilities your other characters  aren't even remotely OP since you can only use them maybe every 20 minutes and only with a companion out. Everyone is Acting like they are going to be normal use abilities and they aren't, you cant even use them in PvP...

Pay attention to details kiddos...Â
