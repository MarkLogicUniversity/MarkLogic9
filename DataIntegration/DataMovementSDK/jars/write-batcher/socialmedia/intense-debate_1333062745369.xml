Misogyny is fundamental to the basic writings of Christianity. In 
passage after passage, women are encouragedâ€”no, commandedâ€”to accept an 
inferior role, and to be ashamed of themselves for the simple fact that 
they are women. Misogynistic biblical passages are so common that itâ€™s 
difficult to know which to cite. From the New Testament we find "Wives, 
submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the 
husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the 
church. . . ." (Ephesians 5:22â€“23) and "These [redeemed] are they which 
were not defiled with women; . . ." (Revelation 14:4); and from the Old 
Testament we find "How then can man be justified with God? Or how can he
 be clean that is born of a woman?" (Job 25:4) Other relevant New 
Testament passages include Colossians 3:18; 1 Peter 3:7; 1 Corinthians 
11:3, 11:9, and 14:34; and 1 Timothy 2:11â€“12 and 5:5â€“6. Other Old 
Testament passages include Numbers 5:20â€“22 and Leviticus 12:2â€“5 and 
15:17â€“33.

Later Christian writers extended the misogynistic themes in the Bible 
with a vengeance. Tertullian, one of the early church fathers, wrote:



In pain shall you bring forth children, woman, and you shall turn to 
your husband and he shall rule over you. And do you not know that you 
are Eve? Godâ€™s sentence hangs still over all your sex and His punishment
 weighs down upon you. You are the devilâ€™s gateway; you are she who 
first violated the forbidden tree and broke the law of God. It was you 
who coaxed your way around him whom the devil had not the force to 
attack. With what ease you shattered that image of God: Man! Because of 
the death you merited, even the Son of God had to die. . . . Woman, you 
are the gate to hell.



One can find similarly misogynisticâ€”though sometimes less 
venomousâ€”statements in the writings of many other church fathers and 
theologians, including St. Ambrose, St. Anthony, Thomas Aquinas, St. 
Augustine, St. John Chrysostom, St. Gregory of Nazianzum, and St. 
Jerome.

	
This misogynistic bias in Christianityâ€™s basic texts has long been 
translated into misogyny in practice. Throughout almost the entire time 
that Christianity had Europe and America in its lock grip, women were 
treated as chattelâ€”they had essentially no political rights, and their 
right to own property was severely restricted. Perhaps the clearest 
illustration of the status of women in the ages when Christianity was at
 its most powerful is the prevalence of wife beating. This degrading, 
disgusting practice was very common throughout Christendom well up into 
the 19th century, and under English Common Law husbands who beat their 
wives were specifically exempted from prosecution. (While wife beating 
is still common in Christian lands, at least in some countries abusers 
are at least sometimes prosecuted.)


At about the same time that English Common Law (with its wife-beating 
exemption) was being formulated and codified, Christians all across 
Europe were engaging in a half-millennium-long orgy of torture and 
murder of "witches"â€”at the direct behest and under the direction of the 
highest church authorities. The watchword of the time was Exodus 22:18, 
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live," and at the very minimum 
hundreds of thousands of women were brutally murdered as a result of 
this divine injunction, and the papal bulls amplifying it (e.g., Spondit Pariter, by John XXII, and Summis Desiderantes, by Innocent VIII). Andrew Dickson White notes:



On the 7th of December, 1484, Pope Innocent VIII sent forth the bull 
Summis Desiderantes. Of all documents ever issued from Rome, imperial or
 papal, this has doubtless, first and last, cost the greatest shedding 
of innocent blood. Yet no document was ever more clearly dictated by 
conscience. Inspired by the scriptural command, "Thou shalt not suffer a
 witch to live," Pope Innocent exhorted the clergy of Germany to leave 
no means untried to detect sorcerers . . . [W]Itch-finding inquisitors 
were authorized by the Pope to scour Europe, especially Germany, and a 
manual was prepared for their use [by the Dominicans Heinrich KrÃ¤mer and
 Jacob Sprenger]â€”"The Witch Hammer", Malleus Maleficarum. . . . With the application of torture to thousands of women, in accordance with the precepts laid down in the Malleus,
 it was not difficult to extract masses of proof . . . The poor 
creatures writhing on the rack, held in horror by those who had been 
nearest and dearest to them, anxious only for death to relieve their 
sufferings, confessed to anything and everything that would satisfy the 
inquisitors and judges. . . . Under the doctrine of "excepted cases," 
there was no limit to torture for persons accused of heresy or 
witchcraft.



Given this bloody, hateful history, itâ€™s not surprising that women have 
Always held very subservient positions in Christian churches. In fact, 
there appear to have been no female clergy in any Christian church prior
 to the 20th century (with the exception of those who posed as men, such
 as Pope Joan), and even today a great many Christian sects (most 
notably the Catholic Church) continue to resist ordaining female clergy.
 While a few liberal Protestant churches have ordained women in recent 
years, itâ€™s difficult to see this as a great step forward for women; 
itâ€™s easier to see it as analogous to the Ku Klux Klanâ€™s appointing a 
few token blacks as Klaxons.


As for the improvements in the status of women over the last two 
centuries, the Christian churches either did nothing to support them or 
actively opposed them. This is most obvious as regards womenâ€™s control 
over their own bodies. Organized Christianity has opposed this from the 
start, and as late as the 1960s the Catholic Church was still putting 
its energies into the imposition of laws prohibiting access to 
contraceptives. Having lost that battle, Christianity has more recently 
put its energies into attempts to outlaw the right of women to abortion.
 


Many of those leading the fight for womenâ€™s rights have had no illusions
 about the misogynistic nature of Christianity. These women included 
Mary Wollstonecraft, Victoria Woodhull, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and 
Margaret Sanger (whose slogan, â€œNo God. No master,â€&#157; remains relevant to 
this day).
