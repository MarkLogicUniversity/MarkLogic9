Could it be that once again, our unworthy President has put his foot in his mouth and insulted his 'base' by ....and this had me on the floor laughing, by telling them to get  the sofa, Â 'take Off their house shoes' and help instead of complaining!" Â Amazing, stunning arrogance.  Just last week he begged them for their 'love!'. Â  Â He might as well have told them to 'put down the pipe' and stop shufflin' around like a bunch of eye rollin' Aunt Jemima's and St.eppin' Fetchit's, Â set aside the fried chicken and waterrrrmelon and come down out of the trees! Â  Obama's insults know no color line. Â I hope he gets big Heat for his remarks to the Bblack Caucus which he USES to divide our country for his hideous political machinations. Â 

I move everyone completely ignore the profound moron bertmanlives today and not answer him. Â It's hard, I know, because his job on FOX is to inflame.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/mayugs</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/president-obama/2011/09/25/obama-loses-cool-black-caucus-dinner-stop-complaining-and-march</link><postedTime>2011-09-25T14:35:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-09-25T18:44:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/g6ldq5</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/president-obama/2011/09/25/obama-loses-cool-black-caucus-dinner-stop-complaining-and-march#comment-319697968</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8nldh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-09-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
