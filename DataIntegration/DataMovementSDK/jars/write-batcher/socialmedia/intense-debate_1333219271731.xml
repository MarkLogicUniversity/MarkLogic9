It'll be hard.  You'll definitely feel confused for awhile.  After I quit, my Grandfather (one I wasn't especially close to) introduced me at an anniversary party (his and my Grandmother's 50th wedding anniversary) by saying, "This is Kelly, who wasted all of her parents money all those years by deciding not to swim in college anymore."  He had a dry sense of humor and thought he was being funny, but not so much.  But yeah, I still get asked if I "still swim" all the time.  

Anyway, enjoy your open weekends and mornings that you don't have to get up super early.  I'll never miss that!  :)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67mumr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tdqu</id></website><link>http://www.xojane.com/node/27061</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:00:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T21:02:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwtfak</id><link>http://www.xojane.com/node/27061#comment-481195795</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6aiom</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
