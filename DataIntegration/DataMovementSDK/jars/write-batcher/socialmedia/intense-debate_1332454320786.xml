"Take up the White Man's Burden,
Send forth the best ye breed,
Go bind your sons to exile,
To serve another's need.
To wait in heavy harness,
On fluttered folk and wild,
Your new-caught sullen people,
Half devil and half child.

Take up the White man' Burden,
In patience to abide,
to veil the threat of terror,
and check the show of pride.
By open speech and simple,
A hundred times made plain,
To seek another's profit,
And work another's Gain.

Take up the White Man's Burden,
The savage wars of peace,
Fill full the mouth of famine,
And bid the sickeness cease.
And when your goal is nearest,
The end for others sought,
Watch sloth and heathen folly
Bring all your hopes to nought.

Take up the White Man's Burden,
No tawdry rule of kings,
But toil of serf and sweeper,
A tale opf common things.
The ports ye shall not enter, 
The streets ye shall not tread,
Go make them with your living, 
And mark them wirth your dead.

Take up the White Man's Burden,
And reap his old reward,
The blame of those ye better,
The hate of those ye guard.
The cry of hosts ye humor,
Ah slowly toward the light,
'Why brought ye us fromk bondage,
Our beloved Egyptian night?'

Take up the White Man's Burden,
Ye dare not stoop to less,
or call to loud on freedom,
To cloak your weariness.
By all ye cry or whisper,
By all ye leave or do,
The silent sullen peoples,
Shall weigh your gods and you.

Take up the White Man's Burden,
Have done wirth childish ways,
The lightly profffered laurel,
The easy ungrudged praise.
Comes now to search your manhood,
Through all the thankless years,
Cold-edged with dearbought wisdom,
The judgement of your peers."

...the more things stay the same, I guess.
