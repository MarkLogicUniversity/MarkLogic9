The minute you decide you need to lose weight you've already failed. Almost everyone wants to lose weight, because advertisements tell us we ought to, and the media tell us if we lose weight we'll find love, people will like us, we'll get that promotion, we'll finally be happy... what a crock! If I make healthy choices it needs to be because I LOVE my body and want it to be healthy, not because I HATE my body and want it to look different! I find it appaling that such ignorant rubbish is posted under the guise of "HEALTHland" - when most Weight loss efforts are terribly UNhealthy and disappointing. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/df7p1h</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/v3kr</id></website><link>http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/04/diet-disruptor-how-the-brain-sabotages-weight-loss/</link><postedTime>2012-01-04T15:02:42+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-01-04T17:32:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/ebvcj4</id><link>http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/04/diet-disruptor-how-the-brain-sabotages-weight-loss/#comment-400499982</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dltff</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-01-04</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
