youâ€™ve been alive I was taught context was everything. Itâ€™s not only important 
in the sentence, paragraph or article but, also, where what you write falls in 
the greater scheme of things. At this time there is an emotion filled national 
uproar going on over this young manâ€™s death, rightly so. At the same time there 
are other individualâ€™s lives being ruined. They are being excoriated without 
facts, indeed, there are even death threats. In fact, I doubt the hysteria has 
Reached the point of culmination. I think, you may disagree, that there is such 
a thing as a writerâ€™s social responsibility as to the type and timing for the 
vehicle they display their thoughts through. I find the timing for using new 
popular entertainment, intertwining it with the immediacy of this very real 
tragedy obscene. At the moment it trivializes a heart rendering tragedy. The 
timing smacks of opportunism, should it have appeared after there was some sort 
of closure, as a reflection upon what could be learned in the aftermath perhaps, 
it could have been 
appropriate.

 

At your mention of President Obama 
chiming in I will confess there is little he says that I agree with but on this 
subject I found his remarks completely apropos. I doubt there is any argument 
with this â€œexamine the laws and the context for what happened, 
as well as the specifics of the incidentâ€&#157; and this remark of his â€œgoing to take 
this with the seriousness it deserves, and that we're going to get to the bottom 
of exactly what happened.â€&#157;. Everything he said was right and good. You are 
correct there has been considerable editorializing on this tragedy but what of 
it exemplifies what the president describes? Certainly not the article we are 
discussing.

 

Iâ€™ve been making it a point to read Shirleyâ€™s 
articles, have appreciated them and I think I would really like her were we to 
ever meet but I stand by what I said. Do I expect more from her because I 
like the little I know of her, maybe, if so it would be unfair. I do know she 
can do better, she has in the past. Quite frankly I found Jacquie Kubinâ€™s 
article on this topic the least objectionable of what Iâ€™ve read here which I 
acknowledge is damning with Faint praise.

 

Now, questions for you. You wrote â€œThere's been precious little new to report on the topic, so 
without the editorializing, the case would be dead in the media. Is that what 
you want? Shame on you!â€&#157;

 

Taking into consideration the 
extreme seriousness of the â€˜caseâ€™, to use your word, what justification is there 
for the hyperbole displayed in the editorials? Why is it the only facts given in 
any of them are those that play into vigilante style dialogue? Why are none of 
them quoting any of the facts that doesnâ€™t fit into the popular narrative? Do 
you think with the mass hysteria, the editorializing and sensational reporting 
that the actual facts and the truth will be found or accepted if found? Do you 
think there is any possible way that Mr. Zimmerman could expect a fair judgment 
since he has already been viciously condemned in the court of popular though not 
educated opinion? How important is it for the â€˜caseâ€™ to remain alive in the 
media when it adds nothing to the facts but is detrimental to the living? Do 
those who are editorializing have any responsibility? In every article Iâ€™ve read 
on this horrible event there has been mention of the â€˜Stand your groundâ€™ law yet 
nowhere has the actual language of the law been presented or has read as though 
the writer had actually read it especially here at TWT, why is 
that?
