I so enjoyed going to Gerry park when I was in college just an hour away from Montreal to watch the mets/Expo games. it was so intimate as it was like a AAA/AA field. Could really see Wayne garrett's red hair! Cold but COOL! Then, it was closer and easier to take my kids to Olympic Stadium to see them play! it's where I caught a foul ball Off a carum(sp?) of a railing when I was 9 months pregnant! My kids couldn't understand playing ball inside when they were playing Little league outside!
