It's no surprise that Rhys was furious to hear that his darling sister was with that uncouth brute - because that's the only side of Axis he's ever seen (outside the sexy-Blushing-mewling-uke side he sees after he's fucked him awhile ;D)

But I have a feeling that Evie will find Axis's coquette, gentlemanly side VERY appealing.  In fact, I predict that she'll like it so much, that she'll intend to become a regular customer, and bluntly say so in anger when her brother bursts in like that.

That's when Rhys, who doesn't buy the whole "Axis-is-sweet" thing and thinks he knows better than his sister, will buy exclusive rights to Axis so that Evie can never end up in Axis's barbaric arms again - making Axis EXTREMELY PISSED OFF (two birds with one stone in Rhys's book.)

... *looks up* ... maybe I should just go write some fanfiction.
