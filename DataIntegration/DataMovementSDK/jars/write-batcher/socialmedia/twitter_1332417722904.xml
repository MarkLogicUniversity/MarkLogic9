Ezra is probably right about wind and solar on some base level... (there I said it.. Oh god I feel so dirty)


Heating and cooling represent the majority load in developed countries.

Wind and solar are currently heavily subsidized by every government that deals with it. In addition to that, you can't just turn on wind and solar, you are at the mercy of the clouds and wind. To make matters worse, wind and solar don't work precisely when you need them, high pressure zone = really Cold/really hot = no wind. Night time in winter = no solar.Â  Granted it does work for A/C loads.

The relative size of each unit (2MW for wind, 10's of kW for solar) also create a HUGE maintenance problem. 

The best solution IMHO is probably some combination of nuclear for base load and hydro for demand.
