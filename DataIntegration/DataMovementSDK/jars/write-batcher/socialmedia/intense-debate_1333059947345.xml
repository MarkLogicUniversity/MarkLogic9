Apple shouldn't be marketing it as 4G over here that's true, but as already said, you do get faster 3G speeds (HSPA+) and the UK won't have a good 4G network for at least a year anyway.

I bought a new Ipad, with 4G, knowing it wouldn't work in the UK, and I don't really care now. It's not as if I'm going to return it. I can do anything I want on 3G and WiFi anyway. 

Even if I did have 4G, my network would no doubt restrict it, thus limiting it's appeal. Apparently US users are 'Burning' through their data allowances. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/y0cttl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zv7q</id></website><link>http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44814/at-t-4g-ipad-not-work-uk</link><postedTime>2012-03-08T10:42:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:34:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3q57e</id><link>http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44814/at-t-4g-ipad-not-work-uk#comment-479582754</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-08</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
