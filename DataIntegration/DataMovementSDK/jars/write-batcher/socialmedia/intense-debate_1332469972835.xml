1) An Act and a half of Joel shirtless
2) Michael Jackson in two stages of his life
3) Brown Jamie Lee Curtis
4) A Spot-on Oprah impression
5) A Jeff/Shirley kiss! WHA! Lol
6) Actual, legitimate tension between Abed and Troy
7) EVIL ABED!
8) French Stewart as a French Stewart lookalike
9) The most gifable Joel McHale hotness in a while (AKA: The Horatio Cane)
10) Legitimate information about Jeff and just how bad things have gotten for him
11) Good Britta/Jeff friendshippy, completely non-sexual moments

All in all, I'd call it a win. I laughed my butt of throughout.Â 

Although I do agree with people who have mentioned how cartoonish some of this has gotten. The cutaway gags to the ego apple in Jeff's head reminded me of the clips in his heart last week, and for some reason those jokes just don't work for me. However, I love that Britta used an expanding 'apple' as her analogy, rather than a balloon. She britta'd her thought with another thought's hat on.
