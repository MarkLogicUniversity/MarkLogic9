Was the matter completely over, or were they behind the scenes still looking into it? If these matters can take a year or so to be Resolved, do we know for certain that nothing was being done on their part?Â 

Are they investigating it now, only because of the uproar? If so, wouldn't that be the DA that dropped the ball, and not the police?Â
