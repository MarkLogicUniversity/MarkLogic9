Producing/shipping/running those takes energy.  And the waste from the plastic/heavy metals produced by the tons of discarded (but functional) consumer electronics can't be good for the environment.  (look up how those are disposed of some time, it pretty much involves young third worlders Burning them, breathing in the smoke, then picking the heavy metal remains out by hand, not so good for anyone).

So how about that hippies: refusing to upgrade any electronic item to a new model as long as your current one still functions?
