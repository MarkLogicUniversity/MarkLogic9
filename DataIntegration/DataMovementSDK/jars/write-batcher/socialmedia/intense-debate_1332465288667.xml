Geezuz...the guy was the benficiary of the worst management decision in modern baseball history.Â  He will once again be a wasted Spot on the Giants' roster.Â  His "fan(s)" hopes he can eat up innings... and he definitely will, but the Giants will lose those games.Â  He simply doesn't give the team a chance to win.Â  He can't keep it close.Â  You gotta' pay him...so pay up and cut him, and use the Spot for somebody to help win.Â  OR, pay up...keep him, and lose.Â  Either way he gets paid.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yazvm</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120321%26content_id=27478958%26vkey=news_sf%26c_id=sf</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T20:51:03+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T18:47:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mic0xn</id><link>http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120321%26content_id=27478958%26vkey=news_sf%26c_id=sf#comment-473837816</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g28hh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
