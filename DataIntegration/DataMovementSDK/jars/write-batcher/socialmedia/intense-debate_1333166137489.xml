If you compared to DBSK's Microtic that had 80 million views before it was deleted by SME then your 67 million is no where close to be chosen. "ALMOST ALREADY INVADED JAPAN AND HAS 4 OR MORE JAPANESE ALBUMS" then whatÂ do the boybands likeÂ DBSK,Â BigBang,Â and SUJUÂ meaning to you???Â As much as I know, SNSD are not that welcome in Japan compares to KARA though :))Â If all theÂ  members are so good with Acting, why yoona's dramas has low rate view even with famous actor???? Lastly to you, Mrs Elaine, more members don't mean anything if they can not collaborate

their dance choreography

and have to lipsync during the song chorus. They been together for 5 years so they should be working together well enough to cover each other mistakes but I don't see that in your so call SNSD group. TheyÂ are not that profesionalÂ you see how the leader complains everything, blame on people when she sicks and most importantly, their attitude when they talk with their seniors. 

I support you Ms. Fizzah because anyone can deserve the #1 Spot but not SNSD in my opion.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/y9cfwg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lyjc</id></website><link>http://www.allkpop.com/2012/02/forbes-korea-ranks-the-top-40-celebrities-of-korea</link><postedTime>2012-02-24T18:37:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-10T07:07:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mbxklo</id><link>http://www.allkpop.com/2012/02/forbes-korea-ranks-the-top-40-celebrities-of-korea#comment-461235196</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hk1q1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-02-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
