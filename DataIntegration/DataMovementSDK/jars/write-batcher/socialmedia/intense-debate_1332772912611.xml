There are more JOBS in metro areas.

With the unstable job market, I can't afford to be in the burbs because, at any time, I can be kicked to the curb. At least in a city,Â I've got more than one option in a small area. 

I've been able to Bounce between contracts (temp work) with little time in between. Keeps my resume full, I get experience that pushes my wages higher and I don't have stress from a car commute. I can even afford to be picky with the jobs I take, as there has often been more than oneÂ offer availabe to me. 

To do that in outside an urban area would be an enormous Headache. I'd be driving all over the place. Less stress, more opportunity and, oh yeah, a more lively existenceÂ for about the same net earnings. Car optional.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r6ujn</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/eyjq</id></website><link>http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/why-dont-young-americans-buy-cars/255001/</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T13:00:19+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:30:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkunkl</id><link>http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/why-dont-young-americans-buy-cars/255001/#comment-476431464</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zregu</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
