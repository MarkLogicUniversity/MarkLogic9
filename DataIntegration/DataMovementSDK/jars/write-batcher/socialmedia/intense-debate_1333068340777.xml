Also as a doctor, he doesn't seem to be a big fan of science, which is scary. A global warming denier, anti women's rights, anti gay, doesnt like the department of education,Â  and has a weird obsession with gold. 
I like government interference when it comes to Ensuring that the air is breathable, the water is clean, there is no arsenic in my food, my pain pills wont cause my lung to Bleed, and if i get sick, i don't have to choose between life and my bank account. Too much interference is bad, but ron pauls no interference would give companies free reign to do what they want and that can be seriously dangerous. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/m4qqba</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/h8a5</id></website><link>http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2011/10/2011102683719370179.html</link><postedTime>2011-10-27T10:46:03+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-11-01T22:13:20+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/giysak</id><link>http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2011/10/2011102683719370179.html#comment-353180803</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/r8xwe</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-10-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
