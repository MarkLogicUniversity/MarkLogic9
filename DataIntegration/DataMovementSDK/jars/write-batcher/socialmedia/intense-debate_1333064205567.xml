Â And scalp lacerations Bleed like stink, they don't just magically Close up and disappear by the next day. Â They don't stop BleedingÂ 
until they are sutured or stapled shut. Â The same applies to broken noses, which Bleed copiously until clamped or packed with gauze. Â The lack of visible injuries and the fact that he was not taken to an ER that night tells us that Zimmerman was simply lying about the nature of the "scuffle" that preceeded the shooting.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6za97r</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/police-surveillance-video-of-zimmerman-may-show-head-injury/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T04:19:40+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:30:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ncl9</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/police-surveillance-video-of-zimmerman-may-show-head-injury/#comment-479628026</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/508jd</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
