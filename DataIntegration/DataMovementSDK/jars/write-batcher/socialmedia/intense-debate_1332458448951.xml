When does
the spending in Washington end. Our wonderful senators now want to hold hearing
in relation to the NFL  that the NFL Commissioner just settled. Why
does the senate think that they have to get involved in every issue, and waste
tax payer money that they don't really have to spend! Instead of trying to get
involved in something new. Why don't they try to fix things that have been on
the table for years.



They all
need to go! They are just Bleeding us dry, and they will Always continue to.
