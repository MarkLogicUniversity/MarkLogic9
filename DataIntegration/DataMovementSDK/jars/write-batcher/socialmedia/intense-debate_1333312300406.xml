After the sales, comes the maintenance of the product.

Here is where TATRA ditches the nation and its Armed Forces most seriously.  Once a vehicle breaks down, and this is with disturbing regularity, the company neither has the wherewithal nor the culture to resurrect that vehicle.

TATRA has not established a nationwide network of service centers despite the patronage it has received for 26 years.  On most occasions, its ill equipped and poorly skilled engineers &amp; workmen are not able to rectify faults, resulting in a very large number of vehicles remaining  the road, for years!

In times of a crises, these would not be available, and defence equipment will never Reach the Spot it is intended to be taken.  Instead of targeting the Army Chief, a patriot without a doubt, the nation needs to reflect and seek accountability from all such DPSUs.
