The condition of the cars as far as safety is poor at best. The cab drivers Act like they own the road. A paying customer should not have to share a cab with another paying customer. If I wanted that I would have taken the bus. Should a customer have to share a ride with someone they do not know, who smells like pot and also stinks from really bad Body odor? If there are not enough medallions in the city, call earlier for your taxi. Boston cabs are clean and the drivers are pleasant to their customers. Â Lynn taxi drivers are concerned about their safety, what about the safety of the passengers you randomly group together to make more money for your companies? Really????? This is one business where you DO NOT get what you pay for. Just one more thing in Lynn poorly managed with no accountability.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6d4ex1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ry6y</id></website><link>http://www.itemlive.com/articles/2012/03/21/news/news02.txt</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T07:09:54+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T12:08:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mp36dw</id><link>http://www.itemlive.com/articles/2012/03/21/news/news02.txt#comment-473525026</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/mflw7</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
