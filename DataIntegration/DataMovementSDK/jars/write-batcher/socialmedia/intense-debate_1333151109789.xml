TheÂ battlespace is quite different, as is the population, as are the threats, as are the behavior and characteristics of the enemies.      Â Â Â 

As you pointed out,Â there's very little 'recent' naval combat history in the last 30 years or so to supportÂ either of ourÂ arguments - although the British and Argentinians might disagree on this point considering May is 30th anniversary of Falklands.Â  

However, I believe there is still a bit more applicable naval history to support my theory.Â Â Â If one looks back to naval warfare in WW2,Â theÂ commander who could complete the 'detect' and 'identify'Â portions of the kill-chain firstÂ had a tremendous advantage (see Midway, Coral Sea, Phil Sea, Atlantic, etc.)Â  One could also see the very same pattern in the very short Falklands War and in the way we planned to fight the Cold War.Â  Detection + IdentificationÂ = Death.

IMHO, persistent ISR will be a tremendous multiplier in naval warfare.Â  And in terms of technical specifics, BAMS has both a radar (detect) and an EO/IR (identify).Â Â Â It can also go down to 'low altitude' - actually naval aviators have found that as a kind of an important attribute for takeoffs and landings.

But please note that I am not advocating completely shutting down ship production and cranking out only UAVs.  I'm certainly no modern day Billy Mitchell. We need ships to do all the things than only ships can do - boardings, platforms for maritime , etc.  I think you've well over-interpreted my argument in that regard.

My argument is not binary; we need ships, just maybe less of them - or more aptly less of the 'wrong kind'.  I am advocating a balanced and objective look at the merits of ISR versus 'low-end' ship force structure.Â  And when I say low end, I am very much targeting LCS.  

IÂ Â think we're actually in agreement as to what a 'modern frigate' can do.Â Â I also think we could use more frigates - which provide presence, but also staying power, survivability, and warfighting utility. Unfortunately,Â theÂ Navy'sÂ not at all interested in building frigates!  

They are interested in building LCS - which isÂ in effect an overpriced cutter, designed to operate in an environment where it has no hope of surviving, nor providing much in the way of warfighting utility.  The bestÂ LCS isÂ going to be able to do is a bit of presence and ISR, and maybe take on a pirate or a cabin cruiser full of girl scouts on equal terms.Â  In an actual war, it will likely be shunted aside so it doesn't hurt itself or the rest of the .

I'll trade the cost of LCS for the same amount ofÂ Airborne ISRÂ any day of the week.  I'd much rather have another BAMS orbit up in the sky, surveying vast tracts of ocean and cueing my ships which can actually do something about it (i.e. DDGs or better still lots of long endurance FFGs), vice a bunch of overpriced, hapless little crappy ships jetting around at 30+ knots around with radar and binoculars.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zc7wg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/54so</id></website><link>http://www.informationdissemination.net/2012/03/brand-new-approximately-300-ship.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:07:11+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:28:02+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ubkc</id><link>http://www.informationdissemination.net/2012/03/brand-new-approximately-300-ship.html#comment-479793279</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/w1pv</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
