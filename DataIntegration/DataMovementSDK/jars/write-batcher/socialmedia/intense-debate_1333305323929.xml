She was 6 at the time.  I thought she had mono, but that tested negative.  Once this Tiredness started, it just never let up.  As the months went by, we noticed that she also was Gaining alot of weight.  She was having nightmares, and started some sleepwalking.  She was also having some sleep hallucinations.  The only Muscle weakness she has, is that her eyes sometimes get droopy, especially when she is laughing... and her tongue seems to get effected (it will look like and sound like she is talking with a swollen tongue- I think its just that she loses control of this muscle).
Is your daughter tired alot? Does she fall asleep almost instantly when she is in the car?  My daughter would fall asleep on a ten minute ride to run errands even though she had only awoken 2 hrs. before!  I would highly recommend a consult with a pediatric sleep lab, or, if she is not showing the signs of Tiredness, then maybe a pediatric neurologist.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ew67mm</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/bmgf</id></website><link>http://www.aboutnarcolepsy.org/87/narcolepsy-in-children/</link><postedTime>2011-09-20T15:29:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T12:52:59+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwio53</id><link>http://www.aboutnarcolepsy.org/87/narcolepsy-in-children/#comment-481806321</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-09-20</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
