Trayvon walked to the convienience store geta bag of skittles and an ice tea. So what if he had his hood up, maybe he was Cold. its not like he was causing you or anyone else harm by going to the store, okay. Also, if black people want to live their life by puttin on a gangster Act. so what let them be, they arent hurting you. so why does it matter? You might've been offended but it had nothing to do with you. Get over yourself, grow up. You just sounded like a complete racist. Go give yourself a reality check, come back and make a new comment.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zclg5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/second-trayvon-martin-twitter-feed-identified/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:00:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T14:46:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwy446</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/29/second-trayvon-martin-twitter-feed-identified/#comment-480814066</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
