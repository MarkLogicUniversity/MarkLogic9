Is there a"home" for them to go to?---and then I thought what if there isn't anymore...and that's why they are doing what they do? --Like Peter they are trying to "recreate" the 'timeline' they came from, because they lost or destroyed it...There are a lot of David Bowie references, and the Observers look like the Martians from "The Man Who Fell to Earth"...Bowie's character, Thomas Jerome Newton (Cough Cough) left Mars to get the resources he needed to save his family...Then what if episode 19 is a flash back to the time the Observers and the people they work for lost their universes?? Then Peter's story mirrors theirs.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6e0hvv</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/g6o1</id></website><link>http://www.spoilertv.com/2012/03/fringe-season-4-wondercon-video.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-19T10:27:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-19T17:37:07+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mjr9te</id><link>http://www.spoilertv.com/2012/03/fringe-season-4-wondercon-video.html#comment-469160394</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g7ykj</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-19</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
