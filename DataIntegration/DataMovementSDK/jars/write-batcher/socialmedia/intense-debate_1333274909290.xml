At the end of Bush's term we were losing almost 1 million jobs PER MONTH. Since Obama was elected, the Bleeding has stopped, and the healing has started. We have been Gaining jobs every month for the last 1.5 years.

It takes some time to recover from 2 wars, big unnecessary tax cuts, and medicare part D. We still have a lot of work to do.
