For most home lighting, you want a 'warm white' bulb in the 2500-6000k light range, while bulbs in the 7000-9500k light range are 'painfully white-blue' in color  (replacing an average 60-watt incadescent happens best around 3500k).  By the way, LED's are the primary light you desire when you go -grid and use DC power from a  bank recharged by solar panels or wind mills. LED bulbs are approximately 800% more efficient users of power than incandescent, and will reduce your power consumption by a factor of 8 (+/-). As a result, they will reduce your summer cooling expenses too, because they light-without-Heat. Most RV owners already know this - I refitted my RV with LED's and watched my DC Battery bank charge-lifespan increase almost 3-fold.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zta6d</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6v05</id></website><link>http://www.wired.com/reviews/2012/03/led-lamps/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:03:57+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:19:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31j02</id><link>http://www.wired.com/reviews/2012/03/led-lamps/#comment-479846556</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cypuk</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
