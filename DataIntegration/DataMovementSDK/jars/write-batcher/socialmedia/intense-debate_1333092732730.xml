PAC's as a "threat to our democracy.â€&#157; This month, his re-election campaign
confirmed that both administration and campaign officials will fundraise for
Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing the president.Â IfÂ there was an award
for "Most Damage and Hypocrisy," Barak Hussein Obama-Soetoro would
have won it years ago. His supposed claim for the poor and middle class. His
stance on immigration and the fight on terror. His claim just two years ago
about the dangers of raising taxes during a recession. His "concerns"
for Israel. All are bogus. All are deceptive. All are crafty means to an end.
He talks a great speech but like a crafty snake-oil salesman, he will Burn you
in the end.Â  He's a knee-jerk Alinsky Marxist, a greedy, two-bit community
organizer who has been used and manipulated by others -- e.g., billionaire
George Soros, et al., the Chicago Democrat Mob, etc. ad nauseam. He clearly is
a willing fool as they've rewarded him with riches and power, both of which he
has ostentatiously abused with abandon. Here's just oneÂ Act of hypocrisy
that boggles the mind. Remember when Obama descended upon CIA headquarters in
Langley to thank them for the work they did that made the wasting of Osama bin
Ladin possible? He did so, however, in a speech where he said "I" 36
times, "my" six times, and "me" twice, all in a speech that
lasted only 13 minutes! Plus, this praise came at the same time his corrupt
Attorney General Eric Holder is conducting a criminal investigation of the CIA
for doing what Obama was praising them for. No surprise there -- whatever he
says todayÂ is subject to reversal tomorrow and denial the next day. Is Romney guilty of this, too? Of course. But let's not lose sight of the clear winner here.
