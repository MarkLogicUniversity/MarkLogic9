At the centre, the shows (I'm only talking TOS and TNG here) have Always been about a sort of moralistic utopianism, with science playing a very small part in it. Â Most episodes go something like "look at how horrible these people and societies are! Â Too bad they couldn't be as wonderful as the Federation is!" Â From the Nazi planets to the god-like beings, it's all about social commentary (and isn't kind of telling how all the utopias they ever find are never as good as the Federation?)That's what made Star Trek good - this utopian ideal. Â If you focused on the science in the show, you'd just get a Headache.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h32z5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/cbs-and-possibly-jj-abrams-have-put-a-stop-to-that,71628/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T23:15:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:33:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ngn2</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/cbs-and-possibly-jj-abrams-have-put-a-stop-to-that,71628/#comment-479630880</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dto1o</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
