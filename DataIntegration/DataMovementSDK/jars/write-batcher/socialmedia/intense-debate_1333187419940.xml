His bat is hot, he isn't hurting anyone defensively and he appears to be a solid player vs. Laynce Nix. I remember Nix hurting the Phils one time last year (I think it was a walk Off hit or HR) but aside from that not much. He was a quick flash in the pan. Unless the coaches &amp; Manager saw something the rest of us did not - I also believe that Podsednik deserves a shot to go North with the team.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z1p1y</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27739880%26vkey=news_phi%26c_id=phi</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:04:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:09:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwl1f3</id><link>http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27739880%26vkey=news_phi%26c_id=phi#comment-480962085</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cstc0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
