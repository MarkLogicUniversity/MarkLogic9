That is an issue for parents to teach their children not our school employees perhaps this is why we are behind other countries . I remember walking to school getting all sweaty and having to sit in a classroom where it was hot and uncomfortable and was not at full attention . I am Glad they are allowing both boys and girls to wear shorts it alway seemed unfair that girls were allowed to wear dresses and skirts giving them some relief from the Heat . I am quite sure they will not expect to wear shorts when they get a job you usually get an employee handbook anyways with all the requirements . Maybe now they can learn more until the next controversy which these seem to me a distraction than what has been claimed to be one .</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z3m31</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ry6y</id></website><link>http://itemlive.com/articles/2012/03/30/news/news02.txt</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:10:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:42:36+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwuy3y</id><link>http://itemlive.com/articles/2012/03/30/news/news02.txt#comment-481456125</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rszfb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
