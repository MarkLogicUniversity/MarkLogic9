I lost #2 with a progesterone level of .08 and a beta of 180 so my system had that part right but was just not in support of the pregnancy. My proj with #3 was borderline and never got high even on supps but it made me feel better and helped my system (IMO) stay on target (to quote Luke Skywalker). I ended up Bleeding heavily throughout the entire 36 week pregnancy but he's 4 1/2 so I guess it worked.  I know there's some debate as to the oral vs vag prometrium/progesterone support. Glad to hear about the hb that does alleviate some fears.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6y7euj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7fwk</id></website><link>http://mwopblog.com/2012/03/open-floor-42/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T10:26:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:32:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi598g</id><link>http://mwopblog.com/2012/03/open-floor-42/#comment-473872109</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/vyit</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
