No wonder you think your cousin did nothing wrong... OrÂ are youÂ Mary this time? Either way you're fucked up.

My sex life is stellar. I have never had trouble getting a man. My curves may be small but they are very non-14-year old boyish. But when you take Off your bra at night and your tits drop down toÂ your knees, and your jelly belly jiggles with the motion of your movements, you can tell yourself that if it makes you feel better.Â 

And I think you are clearly projecting yourself onto me. If anyone sees something fat and nasty when they look in the mirror it's you. When I look in the mirror, I see what could be model material if I weren't 5'6'' so just keep trying. You can go on and on about me being bulimic but that won't make it true. Jaw pain aside, I can eat anything I want, whenever I want, in whatever quantities I want, no Vomiting necessary. But just keep going, you're only proving my point.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/68sgj0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/h9a9</id></website><link>http://www.truecrimereport.com/2012/03/mary_elizabeth_herring_perform.php</link><postedTime>2012-03-13T14:15:28+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:02:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ffvc</id><link>http://www.truecrimereport.com/2012/03/mary_elizabeth_herring_perform.php#comment-479889939</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6mnck</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-13</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
