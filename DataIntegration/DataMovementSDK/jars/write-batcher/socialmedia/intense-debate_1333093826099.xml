The energy that at present has taken up residence in your body, once ruled the earth in the form of a T-ReX.......the "ruler of the dinosaurs!!"......but, after he ate everyone up, and Mother earth froze everyone else up.....Well....time took it's toll, til a couple creatures emerged that would become the current human race....only they were given a power of choice/emotion within them.....that wasn't readily available to a dim-witted blue-blood "Cold blooded" animal......So....the humans didn't play nice with each other.....and did naughty things....until groups of them developed  codes.....and ways to get what they wanted.....and what they wanted....was respect and love.....however (having been treated by others unequally, and forced to do things they rightfully didn't enjoy)....they "Acted out"....and got what they wanted.....and that emotion that is "love"...was simply confused with material objects......and, over the years....translations of "how babies are born" get lost in translation........But, folks......a screw-driver does not cost $4,000......or, in this case....maybe it finally does......MOVE on over driver.....for $4,000....it's time for the "new-underdog" show you what real love is....while reminding you that the original definition of the English-term "Screw"....means to......(well, you get the picture?) Â  Â  Laugh a little bit, if you can....learn a little more, if you choose, and love a lot more....but, try to stop SCREWING every country/race/religion, 'cause someone else "didn't play fair 2,000 year ago...." Â just try.....you might be surprised how happy you'll start to feel.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h6sg6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/28/travel/jet-blue-flight-diverted/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T11:10:37+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:47:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m39uoj</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/28/travel/jet-blue-flight-diverted/index.html#comment-479934459</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rc1ii</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
