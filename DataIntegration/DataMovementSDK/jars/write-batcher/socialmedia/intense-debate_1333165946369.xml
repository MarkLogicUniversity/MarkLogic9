The only answer to the health care problem is to lower costs. It's the insurance lobby that can't be budged. Cracks me up that the arguments here, all Heated and extreme, miss the point entirely: that our problem began with the advent of malpractice insurance a coup for extractionist corporatationsÂ that came about, or seemingly became necessary, through frivolous lawsuits. Justices who have awarded outrageous settlements on frivolous lawsuits have much to answer for. They, and insurance companies, have driven the cost of health care out of the Reach of normal individuals. Nobody who makes a minimum wage can afford to pay $150.00 for a first visit to a doctor. Bloggers here would have us believe people who only earn a minimum wage are lazy and not working at all when in fact they probably work as hard or harder than most others. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z0jj0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/f047</id></website><link>http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/legal-challenges/219171-dems-fume-over-justice-scalias-healthcare-comments</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T09:21:52+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:32:02+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwmwqh</id><link>http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/legal-challenges/219171-dems-fume-over-justice-scalias-healthcare-comments#comment-480741529</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
