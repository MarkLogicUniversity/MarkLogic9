You make good points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We need to be exposing corporate greed and banking power as the common enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attacking cops and soldiers who openly state that they will not follow illegal orders doesn't help. It simply produces an antagonistic relationship with people who might otherwise be our allies against the moneyed interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holland, whether he means to or not, comes across as a partisan shill with this and other posts. In fact, a look back at his posts shows that he frequently uses this forum to attack and belittle people he perceives to be "on the other side of the aisle"  but who would probably make good allies against our real enemies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's that saying... "Only a fool fights in a Burning house".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once we have the criminal bankers duly convicted and safely beheaded or imprisoned for life, we can get back to squabbling amongst ourselves over trifles. Until then, alienating people who may share a common interest in that goal should be called out for what it is, Establishment  "Divide and Conquer" strategy.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/8y9htb</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/m28u</id></website><link>http://blogs.alternet.org/speakeasy/2010/09/03/the-oath-keepers-right-wing-domestic-terrorists-waiting-to-happen/</link><postedTime>2010-09-04T01:10:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2010-09-05T16:50:23+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/adpywf</id><link>http://blogs.alternet.org/speakeasy/2010/09/03/the-oath-keepers-right-wing-domestic-terrorists-waiting-to-happen/#comment-75269041</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ag0so</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2010-09-04</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
