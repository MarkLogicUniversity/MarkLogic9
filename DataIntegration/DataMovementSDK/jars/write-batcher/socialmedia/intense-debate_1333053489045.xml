Never did exist.
Some "Blacks" say that it was a hoax,
Some say it was a myth.
But hoax or myth, let’s take a look,
And see if it’s a lie.
Though many have attempted to break it down for "Blacks",
Let me give it a try.In seventeen-twelve the speech begins,
On the james river, it is said.
While rome used cords of wood as crosses,
These "whites" used trees to hang our dead.
This "willie lynch" say, he had caught a whiff,
Of valuable stock that could be saved.
If whites" just listened, he guaranteed to show them,
A better way to make "Blacks" behave.
"Development of a social being-",
"And how to make a slave".
"Take a young "Black" man, his pregnant mate",
"And a baby," now turn the page.
"Just start with the basic principles",
"That you use to break a horse".
"Then you add some other factors in",
"And then, add a little force".
"For fear that "white" future generations",
"May let "Blacks" slip through their hands".
He told the "white" men, to "keep it simple",
"So "white" children could learn the plan".
"Both horse and "Black" men are no good",
"For the economy, you see".
"In their wild and natural state, it’s clear",
"Neither one of them, should be free"."For an orderly future, special attention",
"Must be paid to "Black" females".
"To get her children to fear all "whites"",
"So "whites" can dominate the males".
"Her children must be taught to respond",
"To a particular new language".
"Mental instructions must be given",
"Or to "whites" they can be danger".
"Most "whites" hold above, six basic rules",
"That "whites" believe to be self-evident".
"The horse and "Black" men will surely be",
"Forever, "whites" back-breaking servants".
"Both horse and "Black" men can be dangerous",
"To "white" men, when they’re captured".
"They both will have a tendency",
"To seek their freedom ever-after".
"And in so doing, "Black" men just might",
"Kill "white" men in their sleep".
"So "whites" can not rest, it would take too much",
"To kill a "Black" man once he’s free".
"So keep his body and take his mind",
"The breaking process is the same".
"The horse and "Black" men, both are beasts",
"That "white" men have to tame"."For the continued future of slavery",
"Pay no attention to the old".
"Concentrate on future "Black" generations",
"Get them to sell their souls".
For example, "let’s take a stud",
"And a female horse in Heat".
"And a baby horse, then let’s compare",
"Them to "Blacks" and you will see".
"Now take the horse and lock him up",
"And break him ‘til he’s beat".
"Then take the female and break her down",
"‘Till she’s fearful, confused and weak".
"Then train that female horse, so that",
"She will eat out of your hand".
"Then she in turn, will raise her young",
"To fear "whites" when they stand".
"When it comes to breaking uneducated "Blacks"",
"The same process you will find".
"A different degree, turn up the pressure",
"Do a complete, reversal of the mind".
"Now "whites" should take the meanest and baddest "Black" man",
"And strip him of his clothes".
"In front of all the remaining "Black" males",
"And the "Black" females that he knows"."Now "whites" should tie, each of his legs to a different horse",
"Faced in opposite directions".
"Set his butt on fire, then slap the horses",
"To rip him up his middle section".
"Now "whites" should take, a whip and beat another "Black" man",
"Right to the point of death".
"In front of his woman and his children",
"But don’t kill him, share the wealth".
"Just put the fear of "god" in him",
"For all of the other "Blacks" to see".
"Now he can make more whites", more money",
"With all the slaves that he can breed".
"The negro marriage unit",
"Is something white" men should control".
"Keep "Black" men moving and on the run",
"So his "Black" children can be sold".
"Make the female raise her sons",
"To   on her for help".
"And make her raise her daughters, not to need a man",
"And to  do things for themself".
"Now in eighteen years, when all of her children",
"Get old enough to breed".
"They’ll continue the cycle and make weaker "Blacks"",
"That can’t spell or write or read"."So white" men Cheer, this does sound good",
"But long-range planning, "whites" must do".
"For if the "Blacks" ever learn their history",
"Then, white" dominance is through".
"Now "whites" should keep "Black" females, at the head",
"And "whites" must keep "Black" men, falling behind".
"But if any phenomenon, should switch them back",
"It will be their history, they will find".
"For now, "whites" have no reason to worry",
"As long as, "whites" teach "Blacks", to hate the "Black" race".
"Though the programming may get a little more complicated",
""Blacks" must see "Blacks" as a waste of space".
"But "whites" must control the words "Blacks" hear",
"And keep "Blacks" dumb, so "Blacks" won’t know".
"That when a "Black" man finds his history",
"His education grows".
When you tell a dumb man that "this is ours",
And he doesn’t know the language well.
By "ours", "whites" mean "belongs to "whites"",
To them, ""Black" men are just for sale".
So maybe a man named "willie lynch",
Never even walked this land.
But, what about the things that are in the letter?
Did "whites" do that to africans?I don’t know, it seems they did,
Maybe visiting a "Black" museum could help.
Or maybe one day, when you have the time,
You should read the letter for yourself.　　A "Black Panther" (P.B.C.O.C.N.) Poem By NEETTA BLACK4-29-1978　**A "BLACK" FACTS OR MYTHS POEM..**"The "willie lynch" myth."A "Black Panther" (P.B.C.O.C.N.)
