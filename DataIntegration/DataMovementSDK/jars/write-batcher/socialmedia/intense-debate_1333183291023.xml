This is the same mentality that guided many through the LA riots.
They are nothing more than opportunists.Â  They care nothing about Trayvon Martin.
They only care to advance their own political or financial agendas.
The real crime is that they due a disservice to African Americans by perpetuating hate in this country rather than limiting it.Â  Their own false hatred fuels others hatred.Â  Then we get the snowball effect and before long it gets completely out of control.Â  Just like it is now.
