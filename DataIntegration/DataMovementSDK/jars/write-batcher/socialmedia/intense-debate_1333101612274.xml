The reason contains SPOILERS.

Zuko and Katara are a little too similar; both of them have very intense tempers, and are quick to jump to conclusions a little too quickly. Think of how quickly Zuko enabled Katara's desire to MURDER her mother's killer. Aang knew right away that it was neither what Katara really wanted or needed.

I see Zuko and Katara as representing the typical teenage romance, built on intensity and chemistry, but ultimately one that would Burn them both. I thought Mei was a better force in Zuko's emotional life, and Aang to Katara's... both Mei and Aang served as a balance point, a calm perspective.Â 

But that's also probably me reading into the situation. I was not wild about how the creators handled Katara and Aang up until the finale. I kind of wish they'd left Off the shipping until the characters were older, and Katara had Burned out on her "bad boy" thing.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h7fes</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-western-air-templethe-firebending-masters,71161/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T15:01:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:50:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3jp31</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-western-air-templethe-firebending-masters,71161/#comment-479989068</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzned</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
