I don't know if anyone gave you a heads-up, but it was posted (&lt;a href="http://huggingdogs.tumblr.com/post/20154959466/the-attached-is-a-picture-of-my-husband-iain-and"&gt;here's a direct link&lt;/a&gt;).

The image of Iain napping on the floor next to Dudley reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend waaaay back in high school: Why is it that many animals can  their limbs up to sleep comfortably in all kinds of places, but humans' limbs are all pokey-outy and don't fold conveniently?Â  In particular, I'm thinking of cats, who I would swear have retractable legs. In contrast, I try to curl up with my boyfriend at night, and we Always have at least one arm that just doesn't get a comfortable Spot.

I mean, if I were to nap on the floor like Iain is in that pic, I'd be all knotted up in the shoulders and neck.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67rhhr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ync</id></website><link>http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2012/03/daily-dose-of-cute_30.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:57:37+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T19:59:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwvzn5</id><link>http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2012/03/daily-dose-of-cute_30.html#comment-481135540</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gsw3f</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
