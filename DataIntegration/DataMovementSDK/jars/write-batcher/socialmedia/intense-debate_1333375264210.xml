His death is an unspeakable tragedy and if Zimmerman is guilty, he should be looking at the death penalty. To be honest, looking at the photos of the two appearing in the media, I would be much less alarmed seeing Treyvon walking in my neighborhood (with or without the hoodie) than if I saw Zimmerman.

All that said, is this case getting so much media attention because of race? If so, where is the outrage (especially from the White House) over a case from Kansas City, MO about the same time in which a white 13 year-old boy was doused with gasoline on his fron porch by two black teens who did it because the boy was white. The victim hasn't died ... yet. But he has first degree Burns over much Off his body. Can we have some "racial outrage" over that?</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vw52n</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/02/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-04-02T05:38:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T09:42:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0obut</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/02/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-483385517</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a84lo</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
