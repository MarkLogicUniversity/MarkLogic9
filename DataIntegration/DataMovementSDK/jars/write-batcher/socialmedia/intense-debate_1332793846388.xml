Zimmerman:
We’ve had some break-ins in my neighborhood and there’s a real suspicious  guy. It’s Retreat View Circle. The best address I can give you is 111 Retreat  View Circle.
This guy looks like he’s up to no good or he’s on drugs or something.  It’s raining and he’s just walking around looking about. [00:25]

911 dispatcher:
We’ve got him on the wire. Just let me know if this guy does anything  else.

Zimmerman:
OK.

These a--holes. They Always get away.
When you come to the clubhouse, you come straight in and you go left.  Actually, you would go past the clubhouse. [1:39]

911 dispatcher:
OK, so it’s on the left hand side of the clubhouse?

Time was running out and Zimmerman didn't want this "obvious criminal" to get away.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rtov4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnm3</id></website><link>http://www.sacbee.com/2012/03/25/4365219/churches-amplify-call-for-justice.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T20:43:09+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:21:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkoz5c</id><link>http://www.sacbee.com/2012/03/25/4365219/churches-amplify-call-for-justice.html#comment-476655987</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c70te</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
