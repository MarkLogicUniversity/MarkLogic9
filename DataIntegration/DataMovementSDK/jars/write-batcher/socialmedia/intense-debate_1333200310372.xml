Nor am I expecting fellow Americans to pay my bills if I become seriously ill because I did not buy broccoli. In addition, I will not clog hospital emergency rooms because of a broccoli deficiency.  When I buy fire insurance, I don't feel cheated when my house does not Burn to the ground. 

Despite what Michelle Bachmann claims, health care is a financial burden to many Americans. An article in the Journal of Health Care Finance (Spring 2006, 67-71) noted that a study medical expenses were contributing factors in 46.2% of bankruptcy filers surveyed  and 54.5% interview and 75.7% of medical bankruptcy filers had health insurance.

Finally, are we not morally obligated to pool our resources together to Ensure that health care is available to individuals who become ill, including ourselves? Freedom has such a nice ring to it, but freedom from obligations to the community rings hollow.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67m1j3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/cusm</id></website><link>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/03/30/bachmann-not-true-that-people-go-without-insurance-because-of-the-cost/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:02:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:12:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwz8jl</id><link>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/03/30/bachmann-not-true-that-people-go-without-insurance-because-of-the-cost/#comment-481026936</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8kh4o</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
