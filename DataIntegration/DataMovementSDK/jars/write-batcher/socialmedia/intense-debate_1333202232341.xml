Education should not be about buying into the academic meritocracy or planning for future payrolls, but instead about discovering a discipline that resonates with and empowers you, a discipline that you can integrate it into your life/being/activities outside the classroom. As students, it is our responsibility to find (or even create) relevant work/life experiences so that we can present ourselves as well-rounded, innovative, and passionate minds and, thus, don't get stuck as a Burnt-out barista (even if it that happens to be where we start).

I'm interested to see whether people think my being an engineering student totally invalidates what I just said.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/66bbjv</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7ux7</id></website><link>http://www.dailycal.org/2012/03/24/student-action-senate-candidates-past-facebook-posts-elicit-controversy/</link><postedTime>2012-03-24T05:55:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-25T21:49:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk77u1</id><link>http://www.dailycal.org/2012/03/24/student-action-senate-candidates-past-facebook-posts-elicit-controversy/#comment-476051460</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
