This whole concept of oil tanks for Heating is insane to me. It is ridiculously expensive AND uses electricity. It's sad to see that natural gas is only just making its way here.  That obviously isn't the only reason but I think there are many symptoms to this problem.

And no, I'm not some city-slicker saying this. I come from a sparsely populated state but I also have a college degree from a great university. I moved TO Maine! Yes, it happens to people who aren't even retirement age. It's difficult to make a living here, that is for sure. Sure it's great that people can enjoy a quiet, rural way of life (and I do) but if the state would update some things, some of us could get along easier.

Who knows. Just spouting Off...and I'm staying here.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zdewt</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dngw</id></website><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/29/business/maine-earnings-growth-ranks-worst-among-states-incomes-lowest-in-region/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T09:48:31+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:32:39+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3f8fa</id><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/29/business/maine-earnings-growth-ranks-worst-among-states-incomes-lowest-in-region/#comment-479860453</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h2emy</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
