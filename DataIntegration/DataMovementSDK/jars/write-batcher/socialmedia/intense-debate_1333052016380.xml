Thats uuprecedented and he could easily arrest all dissidents he considers the enemy which by his definition could be all republicans. Wouldn't that be an easy way to get himself elected? His first order of business would probably be to appoint the New Black Panther party to be his royal guard and comrade Eric Holder to be his Minister of defense and chief of military.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hwwsr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/opxh</id></website><link>http://cowboybyte.com/5764/dem-rep-causes-chaos-on-house-floor-after-giving-speech-in-a-hoodie/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T01:23:39+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:34:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3te2q</id><link>http://cowboybyte.com/5764/dem-rep-causes-chaos-on-house-floor-after-giving-speech-in-a-hoodie/#comment-479491507</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
