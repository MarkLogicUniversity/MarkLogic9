I remember seeing some stats saying that in one city (it may have been Malmo), every single rape in the last "x" years had been committed by Muslims. 
Haver a look at this very bleak article -  
http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/938
"Swedish Welfare State Collapses as Immigrants Wage War" 
The "immigrants", of course, are Muslims.  
A few quotes from the article - 
"â€œWhen we are in the city and robbing we are waging a war, waging a war against the Swedes.â€&#157; This argument was repeated several times. â€œPower for me means that the Swedes shall look at me, lie down on the ground and kiss my feet.â€&#157; The boys explain, laughingly, that â€œthere is a thrilling sensation in your body when youâ€™re robbing, you feel satisfied and happy, it feels as if youâ€™ve succeeded, it simply feels good.â€&#157; â€œItâ€™s so easy to rob Swedes, so easy.â€&#157; â€œWe rob every single day, as often as we want to, whenever we want to.â€&#157; The immigrant youth regard the Swedes as stupid and cowardly."  

"The number of rape charges in Sweden has quadrupled in just above twenty years. Rape cases involving children under the age of 15 are six times as common today as they were a generation ago. Most other kinds of violent crime have rapidly increased, too. Instability is spreading to most urban and suburban areas. Resident aliens from Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia dominate the group of rape suspects. Lawyer Ann Christine Hjelm found that 85 per cent of the convicted rapists were born on foreign soil or from foreign parents." 

"But tens of billions of kroner, some say several hundred billions, are being spent every year on propping up rapidly growing communities of Muslim immigrants." 

"Although Sweden is an extreme example, similar stories could be told about much of Western Europe. As Mark Steyn points out, the Jihad in the streets of France looked like the early skirmishes of an impending Eurabian civil war, brought on by massive Muslim immigration and Multicultural stupidity. Law and order is slowly breaking down in major and even minor cities across the European continent, and the streets are ruled by aggressive gangs of Muslim youngsters. At the same time, Europeans are paying some of the highest taxes in the world. " 
"...we should question whether these taxes are still legitimate, or whether they are simply disguised Jizya paid in the form of welfare to Muslims and our new Eurocrat aristocracy." 

"This is urgent. When enough people feel that the system is no longer working and that the social contract has been breached, the entire fabric of democratic society could unravel. What happens when the welfare state system breaks down, and there is no longer enough money to â€œgreaseâ€&#157; the increasing tensions between immigrants and native Europeans? And what happens when people discover that their own leaders, through the EU networks and the Euro-Arab Dialogue described by Bat Yeâ€™or in her book â€œEurabia,â€&#157; have been encouraging all these Muslims to settle here in the first place? 

There will be massive unemployment, and tens of millions of people will feel angry, scared and humiliated, betrayed by the system, by society and by their own democratic leaders. This is a situation in some ways similar to the Great Depression that led to the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s. Is this where we are heading once again, with fear, rising Fascism and political assassinations? The difference is that the â€œJewish threatâ€&#157; in the 1930s was entirely fictional, whereas the â€œIslamic threatâ€&#157; now is very real."  

I strongly recommend reading this article too - "How will it end?" - about the ultimate fate of islam.

Quotes from the above article - 
"It is more than safe to say that an industrially and militarily unlettered Islam is not going to take over the world using such a feeble tool as terrorism. As was also noted in Part II, Islam is assembling too many enemies too fast and that pace far outstrips any ability of theirs to perfect the mass production of intricate nuclear weapons nor muster fighting forces of even marginal proficiency. Chronic overreach is a hallmark of Islam and its habit of poking at the Western nuclear dragon with its terrorist pointed wooden stick bodes especially unwell for Muslims everywhere." 

"Islam has  demanded to be paid in its own bloody coin. Violence is the only tender it recognizes and all other currency is scorned as a cowardâ€™s coinage. Hudna, taqiyya and kitman all assure that there is no hope of an honorably negotiated peace. Islam wants no such thing. Global domination is its imperative and any re-scripting of those priorities is simply out of the question.

Hardest of all to remember is that this has been Islamâ€™s central doctrine from the very beginning of its existence. The Westâ€™s opposition or threat to Muslims has no bearing on why Islam wages its barbarous terrorism against us. The hammer of violence remains Islamâ€™s only tool and we are all nails in its sight. Islam has already determined how it will end. It is merely a matter of survival for the West and to let Islamâ€™s chips fall where they may. Muslims will forever be cannon fodder for Islamâ€™s eternal jihad. Until they realize this and rebel for once and all time against their warlord masters nothing will ever change.

Remember â€¦ as Always; Islam wouldnâ€™t have it any other way."</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67qbwf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/bejc</id></website><link>http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2012/03/dont-like-it-theres-the-airport/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:33:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T04:11:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw1xmg</id><link>http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2012/03/dont-like-it-theres-the-airport/#comment-481517393</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6eaq</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
