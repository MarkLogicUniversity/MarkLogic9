I have suggested a uniform Burning when He is done.  What a pain the uniform is.  If the board wants to tighten up the uniform then they should have the kids Tuck in their shirts and pull up their pants.  Maybe the teachers and board members should be wearing uniforms as well,  we all know they can afford it besides I have seen a few teachers wearing inappropriate clothing.  (clothing that should be worn in a club).  It is bad enough you have to pay $50 per child per semester for registration.  Maybe the board should look at other things to do that is more productive with the parents money.  I think my taxes will go to the public board when my son is done.  The catholic board has gotten enough of my money.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6cnfpz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/909s</id></website><link>http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2012/03/14/tattoos-piercings-and-hair-dye-are-targeted-among-a-host-of-proposed-new-rules</link><postedTime>2012-03-14T12:13:04+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-14T21:08:31+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mfco5h</id><link>http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2012/03/14/tattoos-piercings-and-hair-dye-are-targeted-among-a-host-of-proposed-new-rules#comment-465430045</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zarx8</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-14</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
