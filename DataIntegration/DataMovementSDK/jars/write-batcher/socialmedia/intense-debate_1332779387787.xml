Javy may have started Off bad last year, but in the end of the year he was a shining Star-----Pitcher of the Month, having won 5 games in one month, moved up a couple of Spots in the record book for SO's. So what you posted sounds good to me accept for the fact that your analysis does not add up. Javy did improve on production, that is what the Marlins would love to have, production like Javy did---improve on what is already a good team!!!!!

Now to further prove that you are clueless, the Marlins were at the top of the NLE with the Phillies, until JJ went on DL, and that was with Hanley having his worst year in MLB!!!!!!!!!!!!! Which proves you do not make any sense at all. What is the name of that medical condition where you read things backwards? </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r4xtt</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://miami.marlins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120325%26content_id=27590958%26vkey=news_mia%26c_id=mia</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T21:35:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:56:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk1irc</id><link>http://miami.marlins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120325%26content_id=27590958%26vkey=news_mia%26c_id=mia#comment-476490351</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5aa1k</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
