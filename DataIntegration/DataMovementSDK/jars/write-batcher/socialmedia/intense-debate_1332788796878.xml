Â 
I had problems with the title and some aspects of this paper as well. However, I think Dr. Watt made many good points in this interview. I am not as knowledgeable about NDE research as I would like. But I have listened to almost all the NDE episodes of this show. I have also read some research, as well as dozens of NDE accounts. I try to be objective and fair in evaluating, as much as it is possible to do so. I would like to believe in a continued consciousness after death. But it seems to me the evidence isnâ€™t conclusive about that. Maybe I am missing some key research, but the points that Dr. Watt makes are ones that had struck me as well, such as:
Â 
--It seems the data doesnâ€™t exclude the possibility that NDEs are occurring while falling unconscious or regaining consciousness. 
--As for the NDE-er knowing events that happened during the period that they were presumed to be unconscious, it seems the possibility of information leakage cannot be excluded.Â  â€œIf you had an ESP experiment where the experimenter knew the answer, then it would be regarded as an invalid experiment, because it would feel that thereâ€™s a possibility of information leakage. Unfortunately, everybody in the operating theater knows the answer and whatâ€™s happening in the area.â€&#157; Thatâ€™s the reason the double-blind method is valuable in science - to prevent research outcomes from being influenced by information leakage or bias of the observer/experimenter. 

There has been discussion in your shows of studies that suggest circumstances of EEG activity and consciousness during clinical death, heart massage, etc. â€¦You mention studies in which perceptions during the time of presumed Unconsciousness from those that had NDEs were more accurate than the control group that did not have NDEs. How does this finding exclude the possibility that the NDE group had a level of consciousness during the resuscitation period that the control group did not have, which would explain both the NDE and the more accurate perceptions? 

You have often referred to the lucidity of the experience as a reason to believe there is not a physiological explanation, but Dr. Woerlee mentioned studies in which many people with hypoxia feel more awake and aware and experience more acute senses, better and faster thoughts, etc.Â  

Frankly, I have found NDE accounts vastly different from one another. Also, some are quite bizarre, some are negative or hellish experiences, and some mention encounters with living people. As for spiritual beings encountered, it did not seem that people were just â€œinterpretingâ€&#157; them differently based on their culture, as Iâ€™ve heard. There were several accounts I read in which the being actually identified himself to the NDE-er (told the NDE-er he was Jesus, etc.)) One person who had a hellish NDE believed it was because he was practicing Buddhism and needed to repent to Christianity, which directly conflicts with some other NDEs. Why would an afterlife be inconsistent between people? Maybe the afterlife is based on each personâ€™s individual reality, rather than an objective reality, but that makes less sense to me.

I have really enjoyed the topics on this show. I like the range of guests and appreciate that both sides of the debate are interviewed. However, in good conscience, I feel I must share that I feel uncomfortable at times with some aspects of the interviews. When Dr. Watt brought up the point about it being really difficult to pinpoint that the NDE was happening at the time of clinical death, it seemed, Alex, that you not only dismissed her point but turned it around to support your own conclusion: â€œThat is really the central issue. We can get away from talking about fear of death or all these psychological factors, thatâ€™s really the central point.â€&#157; (? If we canâ€™t exclude the possibility that the NDE occurred before losing consciousness or upon regaining conscientiousness, then we canâ€™t exclude the relevance of psychological factors.)

It is admittedly difficult to Always come across respectfully when feeling passionate about an opposing opinion. I have gotten the impression that being respectful is your intention. But if I were the guest, I would have felt belittled and a bit bullied by the tone of your voice in parts of this interview, and the way you presented the credentials of the â€œbelievingâ€&#157; researchers. 

From the shows Iâ€™ve heard, valid points or valid research of the skeptics sometimes donâ€™t get acknowledged (unlike that of believers). Leaps in conclusions and problems with research methodology of believing guests are often not pointed out, while this is not the case with that of skeptics. For example, in episode 94, Jeff Long states, in response to being convinced by his research findings,Â  â€œItâ€™s a profound and reassuring message that we all have an afterlife. Every single one of us. And itâ€™s wonderful.â€&#157; I donâ€™t understand how anyone would not see that as a leap when, from his own research, only a portion of persons report an NDE, and some are negative or hellish accounts. Also, even if the research suggests a continued consciousness after clinical death, that is not necessarily the same as an afterlife after irreversible death. I heard no criticism of this statement of Longâ€™s in the interview, yet a lot of criticism was given about one statement by Sam Parnia suspecting the NDE to be an illusion. When asked for evidence that the NDE was occurring during a flat EEG, the evidence that Long gave -- that 98 percent of out-of-body observations during the time of cardiac arrest were entirely realistic byÂ *his*Â assessment â€“- was not questioned for the possibility of experimenter bias. The additional evidence he provided of 60 people who verified their own out-of-body observations seems to me to be weak evidence, which received no critique during the interview either.Â  

I feel itâ€™s admirable that Skeptiko takes a stand against â€œskepticsâ€&#157; filling in the gaps, ignoring evidence, or otherwise being biased in analyzing information. But if truth is the objective, it behooves â€œbelieversâ€&#157; to follow those same standards. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6m3wfy</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcf8</id></website><link>http://www.skeptiko.com/165-dr-caroline-watt-defends-there-is-nothing-paranormal-about-near-death-experiences/</link><postedTime>2012-03-20T15:09:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T05:08:08+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkqd6q</id><link>http://www.skeptiko.com/165-dr-caroline-watt-defends-there-is-nothing-paranormal-about-near-death-experiences/#comment-476228539</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-20</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
