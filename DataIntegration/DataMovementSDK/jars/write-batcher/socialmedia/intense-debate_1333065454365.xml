-doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year, would you have approved?

-then proposed to double the debt again within 10 years, would you have approved?

-criticized a state law that he admitted he never even read, would you think that he is just an ignorant hot head?

-joined the country of Mexico and sued a state in the United States to force that state to continue to allow illegal immigration, would you question his patriotism and wonder whose side he was on?

-put 87,000 workers out of work by arbitrarily placing a moratorium on offshore oil drilling on companies that have one of the best safety records of any industry because one company had an accident, would you have agreed?

-been the first President to need a teleprompter installed to be able to get through a press conference, would you have laughed and said this is more proof of how inept he is on his own and that he is really controlled by smarter men behind the scenes? 

-spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to take Laura Bush to a play in NYC, would you have approved? 

-reduced your retirement plan's holdings of GM stock by 90% and given the unions a majority stake in GM, would you have approved?

-made a joke at the expense of the Special Olympics, would you have approved?

-given the Queen of England an iPod containing videos of his speeches, would you have thought this embarrassingly narcissistic and tacky? 

-bowed to the King of Saudi Arabia, would you have approved? 

-visited Austria and made reference to the nonexistent "Austrian languageâ€&#157;, would you have brushed it  as a minor slip? 

-filled his cabinet and circle of advisers with people who cannot seem to keep current in their income taxes, would you have approved? 

-stated that there were 57 states in the United States, would you have said that he is clueless?

-flown all the way to Denmark to make a five minute speech about how the Olympics would benefit him walking out his front door in Texas, would you have thought he was a self-important, conceited, egotistical jerk?

-been so Spanish-illiterate as to refer to "Cinco de Cuatro" in front of the Mexican ambassador when it was the 5th of May (Cinco de Mayo), and continued to flub it when he tried again, would you have winced in embarrassment? 

-misspelled the word "advice" would you have hammered him for it for years like Dan Quayle and â€˜potatoeâ€™ as proof of what a dunce he is? 

-Burned 9,000 gallons of jet fuel to go plant a single tree on Earth Day, would you have concluded he's a hypocrite?

-OKâ€™d Air Force One flying low over millions of people followed by a jet fighter in downtown Manhattan causing widespread panic, would you have wondered whether they actually get what happened on 9-11?

-failed to send relief aid to flood victims throughout the Midwest with more people killed or made homeless than in New Orleans, would you want it made into a major ongoing political issue with claims of racism and incompetence?

-created positions for 32 Czars who report directly to him, bypassing the House and Senate on much of what is happening in America, would you have approved?

-pronounced Marine â€˜Corpsâ€™ like Marine â€˜Corpseâ€™, would you think him an idiot?

Obazombies: every  described in the questions above is factual and directly attributable to Barrack Hussein Obama. So, tell me again, what is it about Obama that makes him so brilliant and impressive? Can you think of anything to explain these actions of your feckless Kenyan stooge? 

I thought not. Next election, if you still cannot recognize the damage you have done to America, do the rest of the country a favor and stay home
