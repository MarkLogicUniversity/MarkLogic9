"&lt;i&gt;On 1, you are changing the subject&lt;/i&gt;".

No I am not.  The important point is that Colder times/periods are more sensitive to global changes - in BOTH directions - than are warmer ones.  The greenhouse effect, whether "enhanced" or not, would indicate a uni-directional change - not the form of "gearing which is what we observe.

"&lt;i&gt;On point 2, please explain how an enhanced greenhouse could fail to have an influence on global temperatures&lt;/i&gt;".

Your comment is simply illogical.  The global temperatures are changing/have changed.  That is a reasonably well established fact.  You are, in effect, assuming what you are trying to prove, (i.e. the existence of an enhanced greenhouse effect).  There is nothing to suggest that global temperatures can't rise through other means!

"&lt;i&gt;On point 3, you ignore the fact that these observations are spectrally-&lt;/i&gt;"

The particular "little chart" does not mention spectral resolution.  All that the spectrally Resolved data consists of is a sort of large scale spectrophotometirc experiment which shows that there is more CO2 in the atmosphere - a point which few sceptics actually dispute.  To understand what is happening to temperatures, you need to look at the WHOLE of the energy/electromagentic spectrum - not just part of it.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/dtzhuk</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ms5i</id></website><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100125720/more-bad-news-for-the-anti-energy-green-greed-brigade/</link><postedTime>2011-12-22T16:25:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-12-23T13:22:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/et08av</id><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100125720/more-bad-news-for-the-anti-energy-green-greed-brigade/#comment-392986132</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/awlkt</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-12-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
