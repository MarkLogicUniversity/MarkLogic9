I wore pants. It was the most fabulous outfit ever. EVER! Black palazzo pants with tiny white polka dots. The top was a halter top - white with tiny black polka dots. And a jacket - back with white polka dots. When I had the jacket on, I looked like I was on my way to church. But when I took it Off? I looked hot. And from the back, it looked like I was topless. It cost me $35 at Orbachs (a store that closed before most of you were born). 
 
Ten years later, a woman came up to me and told me she remembered my outfit, and had caused quite a stir. 
 
My BF at the time (Hi Harry!) loved it. Of course he got stinking drunk and spent a good part of the prom tossing his cookies in the men&amp;#039;s room.  
 
Then we all went down the shore, at 4am, slept on the beach and had a great (but Cold) day. I have the pics in a box somewhere. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:230559:127952709</id><idPostId>127952709</idPostId><idBlogId>230559</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:230559</id><idBlogId>230559</idBlogId><link>http://crasstalk.com</link><displayName>Crasstalk</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://crasstalk.com/2012/04/prom-season/</link><displayName>Prom Season!</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T02:19:30.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:230559:127952709:329649026</id><link>http://crasstalk.com/2012/04/prom-season/#IDComment329649026</link><postedTime>2012-04-02T02:19:30.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Prom Season! by ditzyblonde</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://intensedebate.com/people/ditzyblonde</link><idEmailMd5>6e2317a2369bb8f2635e8da9d5cde661</idEmailMd5><displayName>ditzyblonde</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/people/ditzyblonde"&gt;ditzyblonde&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://crasstalk.com/2012/04/prom-season/"&gt;Prom Season!&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-04-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
