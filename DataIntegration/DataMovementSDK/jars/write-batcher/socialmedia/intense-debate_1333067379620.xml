We got into this economic MESS because of the REPUBLICANS. that's a FACT!!!! We were doing fine when Bush and the republicans took over. The KEY reasons we went into this mess was 
1. Invading iraq so that Bush could give control of Iraqi oil to his buddies in big oil. Over 3 TRILLION of our tax $ were just Burnt on it.
2. Tax breaks for the Rich - who didnt need them at all. 

Read history - once a country Reaches a certain status of economic growth, you cant grow as fast as you did when you were at a lower level. This is an ECONOMIC FACT. look at china/India. There were growing at over 10% a few years back. Today their growth levels are around 7. 

Ofcourse id love for us to grow at 5 or 6 % but im being realistic.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z7o60</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rvx5</id></website><link>http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/29/news/economy/gdp/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:08:24+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:12:20+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3npzk</id><link>http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/29/news/economy/gdp/#comment-479661799</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/r54v4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
