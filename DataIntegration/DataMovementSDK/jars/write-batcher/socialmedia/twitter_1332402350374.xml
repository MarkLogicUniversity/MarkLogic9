Its been remodelled into a movie and gives some idea ( or reminder ) of what it was like living in the shadow of nucear ahhihilation in the Cold War .
Of further interest its premise for the start of the war was a confrontation between the USA and Russia in Iran that escalated into a nuclear exchange.
Also there was a documentary shot in Hiroshima in 1945 after the nuclear blast called The Efffects Of The Atomic Bomb On Hiroshima And Nagasaki. 
As far as i know it was never been shown to the American public - despite the efforts of Lieutenant ( later Lt Colonel ) Daniel McGovern.
In honor of Lt McGovern's memory Quentin Holt continues his battle by pointing out the 22 minute documentary is on Youtube. Type in the name of doco.
Somewhat sadly  does not appear to have made a movie about Lt McGovern. Shame on you Hollywood. As an incentive i'll point out Lt McGovern was also involved in Project Bluebook.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ya52s</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/8cxx</id></website><link>http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=262858</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T20:37:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T07:41:41+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mpk5sa</id><link>http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=262858#comment-473424769</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/yb3dn</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
