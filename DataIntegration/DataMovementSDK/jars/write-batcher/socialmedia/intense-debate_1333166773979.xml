He called, then followed the kid for only a very short distance, then the dispatch asked if he was following , he said yeah, they said we don't need you to do that, he says OK and stops. The kid runs Off. Zimmerman was walking back to his vehicle to wait for the police to arrive. For some reason the kid came back on his own accordÂ and assaulted Z.Â  Police report indicates that Zimmerman was Bleeding from the nose, his head was bloody, and he had wet grass stains on his back. We have eyewitnesses that say the Kid was on top of Zimmerman beating him.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z3b9t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:25:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T14:31:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwyebp</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-480798677</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5xffr</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
