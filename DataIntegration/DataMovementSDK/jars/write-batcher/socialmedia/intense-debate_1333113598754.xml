My mother Always used to buy me hooded sweatshirts because they are practical. Â Any time it rains or the weather turns Colder, you can cover your head. Â I never thought they looked that great, or felt that comfortable, but I had to agree they are practical.

It never occurred to me that you might think me wearing it gave you the right to shoot me. Â That never entered into my considerations before.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h3tfl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6tdd</id></website><link>http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2012/0328/Why-couldn-t-Rep.-Bobby-Rush-wear-hoodie-on-House-floor</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T23:43:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:05:23+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m34bal</id><link>http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2012/0328/Why-couldn-t-Rep.-Bobby-Rush-wear-hoodie-on-House-floor#comment-479558928</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zz5f4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
