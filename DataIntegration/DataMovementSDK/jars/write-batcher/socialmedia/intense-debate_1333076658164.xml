I am in no way defending him. BUT... I also know that I live in Florida and have a conceal carry permit and if I was getting my ass beat I will use my gun as a means to get the individual Off me.
I wasn't there so I don't know if he bumrushed Treyvon or if Treyvon stepped to him like he says but no one else was there either so we all can't just assume that this was Cold blooded murder.Â 
Personally, I think Zimmerman was a wannabe policeman who was deffinitely prejudiced in thinking that every black teen walking through the neighborhood was up to no good. Zimmerman and Treyvon got into a fight and Zimmerman was getting his ass beat down to the point where he had the shit scared out of him thinking he had better shoot or he might die.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zcaks</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/u6cr</id></website><link>http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh7Fkfv5MhC6Xw4JrC</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T05:42:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:09:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ums4</id><link>http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh7Fkfv5MhC6Xw4JrC#comment-479773890</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzru0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
