1)  on the colors, the shirt may get lost in the blazer. A simple tip that I like to give people is Always make sure there is a clear ending point with one article of clothing and a starting point with another. When things look to similar items get lost.Â 

2) This is a good one except for the black pocket square. My feeling on pocket squares is that they are a stand out item and black has a tendency to get lost because its such a Cold element. The only time I'd do a black pocket square would be with a white suit jacket/blazer for a very strong contrast.Â 

3) Another good choice over all. Red/black are not my favorite for color matches but its a good outfit.Â 

4) Overall this is my favorite. I'd consider skipping the jacket. It makes the outfit a little more casual.Â 

Honestly I like 2 just lose the pocket square or get a white one unless you are going to wear a tie to. That will give you added color and options to draw on for a pocket square.Â
