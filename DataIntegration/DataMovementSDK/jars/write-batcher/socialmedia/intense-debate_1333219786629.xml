Communism is the merging of state and business.

Yes, you're right; they're polar opposites!
Night and day!
I can't believe I couldn't see the distinction before!

"liberalism in no way supports fascism..."
I don't know if you've been paying attention to current events, but the housing meltdown was a direct result of fascism! 
Lookup Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the CRA and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act! Govt. in bed with the Banks!

"The American Sociological Review..."
Sociologists? Can you get any more left wing? (OK, yes; maybe Anthropologists) No bias there, right?
Engineers (applied scientists) trend to conservatism.
Is it because Engineers have to go with what works to solve problems and put that which doesn't in the trash bin?

"And you're getting your info from a Congressional Record published during the height of the Cold War?"
a Red Herring if I ever saw one. 
Did something change in the Communist objective since then?
I would say that they (you?) have met most of their objectives in their infiltration of "Fortress America".
