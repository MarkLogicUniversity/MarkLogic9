"99 Vials of  on the Wall, 99 Vials of Coke..."Â 

WAS OUR PRESIDENT A DRUG DEALER? He did admit that he was "a heavy drug user" and he surely he had to sell the drug in order to support his HEAVY DRUG USE. Did he have a job to pay for college, rent, food, books, etc...? Where's his college roommates who could shed light on their home life? Don't you find it odd that they haven't written a book "Our Life and Times with a Future President."

Now the Pusher-in-Chief is addicting Americans to heroin, disguised as "stimulus/stimulants/entitlements," so in order to get our next FIX, WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR THEM! Those Republicans are like the family on the Intervention TV show where junkies have to be forced to go to rehab but until then, they portray their family as the crazy ones! Even after rehab, the odds are that THOSE JUNKIES WILL RELAPSE AS THEY LOVE TO SLEEP IN THEIR OWN DEMOCRAT VOMIT! Â 

My conclusion: Our President was an ACORN, as in A street CORNer community organizer!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ezsmai</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ry2d</id></website><link>http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=45569</link><postedTime>2011-08-16T18:12:34+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-08-17T12:03:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/5oeart</id><link>http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=45569#comment-289175597</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ajkck</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-08-16</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
