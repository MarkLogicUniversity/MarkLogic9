I was on many different anti-depressants before and no side effects.  I took them for depression.  I'm now on Lamictal for bipolor problems.  II was taken  Celaxa as my doctor felt I didn't need them for depression.  I was also on abilify and that worked great but after I wasn't on anti-depressants any more I didn't feel I should be taking Abilify so doctor took me Off.  No I have sever aniexty.  I was put back on Celax for Anxiety disorder.  I'm affraid I.ll have side effects and am scared of taking it.  I took one yesterday and only had nausa.  II'm afraid of Dry mouth and how long it will last.  Any thoughts on this.. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ecd490</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/qs1h</id></website><link>http://www.anti-depressants.com/drugs/ssri/citalopram/</link><postedTime>2011-07-25T18:13:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:56:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwmyxh</id><link>http://www.anti-depressants.com/drugs/ssri/citalopram/#comment-480709201</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-07-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
