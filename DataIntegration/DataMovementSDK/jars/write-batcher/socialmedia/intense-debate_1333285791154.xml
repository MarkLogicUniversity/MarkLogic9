There is something wrong with that woman and alcohol isn't the only thing. Her daughter's heroin addiction was likely the result of her mother's alcoholsim and not the other way around. Sounds like a few drinks under this woman's belt is the only thing that made her Act "normal" and social. Yes, she did come across as Cold and uncaring. "No Remorse" is the term the Judge's use and can so find at sentencing.
