But mainly the "magic" was in the first principle of the Mormon faith - Obedience.Â  They believe (and I used to teach) that if they obey all the rules the church sets forth for them - including wearing the garment - that then they qualify to be guided in their decisions by the Holy Ghost, which will keep them safe.Â  So, it's more a roundabout magic.Â Â  I will say this - it's a fairly good adultery preventative, as a reminder of ferocious oaths they took in the temple.Â  Which may have been their original point.

Tarico is right - I was all on board with the Mormon project until I came across actual information.Â  It all collapsed like Kleenex.Â  Devastating.Â  But I sure do have more time now, to get things done.Â  And I don't live every minute in that constant "spiritual war between God and Satan" mindset that was so gratifying, yet so stressful.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hcpj2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ant8</id></website><link>http://www.alternet.org/story/154710/former_mormon_what_americans_need_to_know_about_mormonism/comments/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T04:55:04+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T22:35:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3c73x</id><link>http://www.alternet.org/story/154710/former_mormon_what_americans_need_to_know_about_mormonism/comments/#comment-478851177</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/m6g3y</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
