Owning something luxurious should not "shame" one into helping others. I'm pretty sure you are not spending all of your available resources to help those in need. Some people are not as fortunate as others-- this fact was, is, and will Always be there no matter how many Bleeding hearts are available to help. Your comment comes from the point of a financially challenged and jealous member of the society who is constantly exposed to a better life. Instead of shaming that vet, who in turn, made a mistake of mentioning the fact that she drives a BMW (only because most people can't read past that fact) you should get your life to bring you into a better financial state and open your own rescue organization. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/dia1cl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/bhxi</id></website><link>http://www.askavetquestion.com/why-are-vets-so-expensive.php</link><postedTime>2012-01-10T19:52:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:09:41+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwz2pv</id><link>http://www.askavetquestion.com/why-are-vets-so-expensive.php#comment-481024420</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-01-10</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
