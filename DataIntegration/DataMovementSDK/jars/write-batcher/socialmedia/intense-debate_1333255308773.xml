If he can't handle 1b duties fulltime and needs the team he plays for to employ a relatively decent back up option then it's time for him to go back to DHing (idk if he can still play left like Zaun mentioned) I think it may be time for the Jays to move on from the Lind Era. I don't usually agree with Zaun, this time I due. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67lz45</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27757168%26vkey=news_tor%26c_id=tor</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T19:47:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T21:18:21+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw42jm</id><link>http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27757168%26vkey=news_tor%26c_id=tor#comment-481210963</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/csz92</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
