If you look at the tape you can see damage to the back of Zimmerman's head. this has gotten to blown out of proportion. Since Zimmerman and the witness tell the same story I think there might be some validity to it. Martin was no choir boy but since he is black people are finding excuses for it. We do not have all the evidence because it has not been released. The Police can arrest Zimmerman at any time. Give them a chance to find out what really happened. This isn't an hour long TV show. Thing take time.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z3b9t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:25:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:24:28+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwrfhr</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-480916271</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/fw2f</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
