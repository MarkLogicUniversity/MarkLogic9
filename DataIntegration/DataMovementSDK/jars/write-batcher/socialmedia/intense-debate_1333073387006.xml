It seems to me that insurance is something to purchase in case one develops something serious like cancer, or gets into a car crash. The unexpected. And checkups and minor office visits are something to pay Cold hard cash for. Why should one have to go through an insurance company for an office visit. Wouldn't it be cheaper without the bureaucracy and paperwork? I don't think people call their car insurance company every time they need an oil change. 

But I'm not a professional or anything-- just my thoughts. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/666zrj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/23/politics/scotus-health-care-stakes/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-23T16:28:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-24T01:36:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miogj0</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/23/politics/scotus-health-care-stakes/index.html#comment-474965567</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zyxl6</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-23</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
