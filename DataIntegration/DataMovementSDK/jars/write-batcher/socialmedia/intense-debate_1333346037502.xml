How much do you know about the actual investigation? Now, ask yourself how much you think you know about what happened. Those are two completely different things and basing your argument Off the later is an emotional response and not one derived from reason which is exactly what most people are doing. Thus, we have an equally biased media chiming in further inflaming the situation. What really should concern everyone, is when justice is hijacked and ran by a mob mentality. You should be very careful before joining a throng of people running down the street yelling fire. You may not get Burned but you could certainly be trampled to death.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67niuy</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/opinion/roland-martin-protests/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T03:39:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T19:04:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0aem4</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/opinion/roland-martin-protests/index.html#comment-482104494</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dfkt7</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
