Here again are two articles showing how wrong you are,
Current TV founder and CEOÂ Joel Hyattshowed up to theÂ Bill PressÂ radio program this morning and made a splash. Hyatt flew in from Currentâ€™s home base in San Francisco to give Press moral support on day one of the network broadcasting his radio show on TV. FishbowlDC was there and spent a few minutes chatting with Hyatt.Dressed in a blue-jean hued suit, Hyatt arrived on the tail end of Pressâ€™s program, claiming jet lag.Press and fellow lefty radio personalityStephanie MillerÂ are Current TVâ€™s first foray into the daytime live talk game. And Hyatt is promising more surprise announcements on the horizon. â€œQuite candidly, we were dead in the morning,â€&#157; Hyatt tells us. â€œNow weâ€™re very much alive. â€&#157;Then the CEO went full bore on the other networks. â€œThere are only three competitors, and they are all vulnerable,â€&#157; he declared.He called MSNBC â€œinauthentic,â€&#157; CNN â€œvictimizedâ€&#157; by its own legacy as a â€œnewsâ€&#157; network and Fox News at best an â€œinfotainmentâ€&#157; network. â€œThey are liberal by accident,â€&#157; Hyatt said of MSNBC, adding that the network is a â€œconfused, inauthentic brandâ€&#157; that is supported for their ratings and not their views. â€œItâ€™s just not aÂ realÂ brand.â€&#157; He also said CNN has â€œlost its wayâ€&#157; in terms of its identity.Current TV, on the other hand, is the real deal, he said, insisting, â€œWeâ€™re liberal because of who we are.â€&#157;While reluctant to discuss any network controversy surrounding the networkâ€™s â€œbrilliantâ€&#157; star broadcasterÂ Keith Olbermann, Hyatt said the recent debacle involving Olbermann being yanked  campaign coverage was nothing more than â€œjust a big distraction.â€&#157; He acknowledged that more was made of the recent flap than was necessary.Apart from Olbermann, another sore Spot for Current: the cracks on how it is the network no one can find. Hyatt insists this bad rap is changing. On the Dish network Current TV is right next to the Weather Channel. But he admits it hasnâ€™t been easy. On XFinity, the system run by Comcast, a majority owner of NBCU, it is still hard to find. â€œIncreasingly more and more people are finding it,â€&#157; Hyatt says, adding, â€œItâ€™s very hard to start a new media network.â€&#157;Further reading: So What Do You Do Joel Hyatt? See mediabistroâ€™sÂ recent interviewÂ with the CEO.No where Hobo in this interview do they say KO is quiting or he being fired, truth is they are putting more money HObo in this primetime. SO they are not getting rid of anyoneÂ Here another HObo, KO not going anywhere but up, only in your dreams is his ratings decling and he leaving, you will put up a made up model, that will only show that Current is on the increase not decrese.Â Current TV, the cable television channel founded by former Vice President Al Gore and Joel Hyatt in 2005, has gone through some serious changes in its relatively short time on the air.In 2009, it announced plans to shift its focus from the user generated format it was founded on to broadcasting 24 hours of progressive news, commentary and analysis. Then, there was the hiring of Keith Olbermann last summer, followed by that of Internet pioneerÂ Cenk UygurÂ and former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm. And the network just announced that it will be expanding into daytime with six more hours of original programming, including two new shows debuting March 26:Talking Liberally: The Stephanie Miller ShowÂ andÂ Full Court Press: The Bill Press Show.Â Will all that be enough for the upstart to dethrone CNN, Fox News or MSNBC? Hyatt, who stepped back into the CEO role in July, thinks so.
"The fact is... those other three cable news networks have an average age for their audience that starts with a six," he said. "We'd like to talk to the generation younger than that, because they are the ones who are going to make the decisions that will have an impact on our society. They're not retired, sitting at home watching cable news on those three networks all day. Instead, they're active and they're involved and that's who we want to be engaging."

There are a lot of ways to get into the media industry. Why did you decide to go about it this way?
Actually, there are not a lot of ways you can get into the cable television industry. There are virtually no ways you can get into it, and that's an important point. It's an industry controlled by an oligopoly. And Al and I tried to get into that industry on our own by starting a new cable network, but we were unable to get any distribution agreements from any of the distributors. As a result, we found a little network to buy as a way to get into the industry. So, we bought News World International from Vivendi when Vivendi was selling its media assets. But that gave us a base. NWI at the time had distribution agreements for just 17 million subscriber households in the U.S., so that for us was a base on which we could build something. Today, Current is available in 60 million subscriber households, but that was the entry into what was a closed industry.

"Today, there is no media company in the world that doesn't want to engage audiences --Â noneÂ did when Al and I launched Current"Can you talk more about the oligopoly in cable television that you're trying to go up against?Almost all, and darn near all, television networks are owned by a handful of companies. Some of those companies not only have content but distribute the content through cable systems, and so it's a very, very controlled industry where a very few number of companies control what all Americans see, what information they get. And we just felt that there needed to be independent voices heard; there needed to be more of a diversity of voices heard, but most importantly, our ambition was to take the power of the platform and share it with our audience and with our users.
Today, there's no media company in the world that is not spending a lot of time trying to engage its audience, get them to participate with the content, get them involved. All media companies do that today --Â noneÂ did it when Al and I launched Current. None. So we're really proud of that. It's part of our DNA and it's part of what we set out to do. And we've done it, frankly, not just for our company but we're pleased to say, for the entire media industry.
It seems like now Current is moving away from user generated content as you try to establish yourselves as a progressive news network. Where do you see user generated content fitting into the new direction of Current?It's part of our DNA. It's still very important to us that viewers and users are engaged and involved with our content, so participatory features will be used in all of our programming. You're right that we no longer are trying to have a television network that is entirely premised on user generated content. At the end of the day, our conclusion was, that didn't work. And so our programming direction right now is very, very clear: We are all in as a political commentary and news analysis networkâ€¦But we will continue to innovate ways in which our viewers and users can participate, can be involved, can engage with the content, can contribute content. That's  going to be part of who we are.
Keith Olbermann came from one of your rival networks. How has your relationship with him developed over the past few months? There has been a lot of news about management clashes with him...That's all distracting to us. We don't pay attention to that. Keith puts on a great show and he has a loyal following. Most importantly, the decision to bring Keith to Current TV is what clarified for our network the strategic vision in which we were heading.
What are you looking for in new talent when you bring on hosts like Cenk or your new daytime hosts Stephanie Miller and Bill Press?We'll  be looking for really thoughtful, insightful commentators who have something important to say. If there's a guidepost, that's clearly it. We're looking for people who are intelligent, who are fact based, who care about seeking truth. All of that's going to be very, very important to us... Stephanie and Bill already have large followings and that's useful for a young, growing network, because we're hoping that their followings will indeed follow them to Current TV. And same with Cenk.
We're going to look for budding journalists, young journalists who we think are really smart with a bright future, get them on Current. We're going to look for practitioners of public policy, like Jennifer Granholm. Weâ€™ll soon be naming others in that category, people who have actually done the hard work of public service and who are very committed to it, who understand it from the inside. They know spin when they hear it; they know BS when they hear it; they can stand up to it because they've been there and done that. So, we're going to have a mixture. And really the exciting part of building what we're building is finding really talented people who have important things to say and giving them a platform to do that.


"We've seen so much of professional journalism replaced by infotainment, entertainment and, frankly, pure fraud."What is your end goal for Current over the next few years and long term? How do you plan to increase viewership and grow the channel?Our goal for Current is to influence the conversation of democracy. We want to have an impact on the public policy discussion. And to measure how we're having an impact, ratings is as good an index as any other. As a cable television network, we live with ratings in any event, and it's as good a proxy as any as to whether we're building an audience through which we can have the impact that we seek. We are growing our ratings steadily. We're very pleased with the progress. We're going to be doing more marketing, more social media, more PR to drive increased viewership. Truth be told, we've done very little marketing historically, but you really have to have a slate of programming to justify that. But for the first time, this year, we're going to put millions of dollars behind marketing our lineup, because we now have a great lineup and we need to tell the world that it's there, because we know that when people tune into it and experiment with it theyâ€™ll become loyal viewers.
As someone who previously worked in politics, what is your take on cable TV election coverage and the current coverage of the Republican primaries and Presidential race?There are times in which the cable networks do a really outstanding job; there are times in which I think the job they do is embarrassingly bad. I think that what journalism needs to do is seek truth. And that means care about facts, care about science, care about reasoning, and help provide context to the audience, so the audience can understand how these issues affect their lives, so the audience is better able to connect the dots between disparate issues and disparate events and what they mean in the larger context.
That's the true purpose of journalism: find and seek the facts, the truth. Convey it; explore it; create context for it; connect the dots. We're very proud of the work we're doing in that regard. Are there programs on our competitor networks that do that? Yes. Is that the general rule on those networks? No. That's not just my opinion. The reality is we've seen so much of professional journalism dissipate away to be replaced by infotainment, entertainment and frankly I think pure fraud, since it's being passed along, purported to be news. It's just a fraud to call it news.
Thier is nothing that is saying that Current is getting rid of him. Also they would lose Hobo a lot of viewers.Â 
Truth is you and Unicorn again have been making a big deal about a quater where KO has not been around very much. He was  most of January and Febuary because he was sick. So if what you two love to claim is true. This Hobo would only show why KO will be on Current and not Fox Sports, it will show just how much Current needs him.Â 
Hobo Current is doing fine in the ratings. You and Unicorn have shown that. You made up a model of cherried picked numbers, you made up a model that puts demos and totals togther and you are trying to pass it Off as the truth. Sorry all that model will show like your made up BS that whole quater evening numbers is the same as the total day numbers, which by the way HObo, KO has nothing to do with day ratings so what your saying does not even effect him.Â 
HObo Hyatt is putting more money to advirtise this line up including KO, so sorry the bad news for you and Unicron KO is going no where but up as your model will show.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z2aq8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/vr8i</id></website><link>http://current.com/shows/countdown/videos/jetblue-passenger-tony-antolino-explains-his-role-in-restraining-captain-clayton-osbon</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T02:34:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:02:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3p5rx</id><link>http://current.com/shows/countdown/videos/jetblue-passenger-tony-antolino-explains-his-role-in-restraining-captain-clayton-osbon#comment-480049185</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/es9mj</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
