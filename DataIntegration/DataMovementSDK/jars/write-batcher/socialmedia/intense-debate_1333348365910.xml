How long have they been around for? And yes i love them. Are you Always right? Bought normal jeans colour and aubergine. Now realised I only have one tshirt that I like to wear with them. Too hot for knits yet. Need longer line to cover my bum a bit. Sussan website looks like they might have some good stuff. Will head there soon. 

Can't wait to receive new handbag from Witchery online. Leopard print with chain strap. Loved it when first out, but couldn't justify it. With sale and various credits and discounts was down from around $230 to $145. Why do they take so long to send their stuff though? Very impatiently waiting. 

Also got my eye on Ecco shoes tan bag that Fox in Flats instagrammed recently. Looks sooo luscious. Am dreading finding out the price in case too exy. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vpaob</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/hxb9</id></website><link>http://www.stylingyou.com.au/2012/04/shopping-confessions-have-bought-lately/</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T23:13:00+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T03:51:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m09e3h</id><link>http://www.stylingyou.com.au/2012/04/shopping-confessions-have-bought-lately/#comment-483271825</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c1151</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
