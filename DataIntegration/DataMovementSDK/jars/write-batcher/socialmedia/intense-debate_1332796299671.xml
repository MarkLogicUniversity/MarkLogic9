The Steelers won't have a ton of roster Spots up for grabs, right? It seems like it's almost like the chance to draft some guys who they otherwise would have pursued as UDFAs, which is a nice luxury. And there are Always those USFAs who stick... like Saunders, Clay, Legursky, Foster, etc. I guess you draft some "upside" guys who can hope to make the practice squad to develop. I guess you're happy if 1 or 2 pan out. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lc1vg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/qq8s</id></website><link>http://www.steelersdepot.com/2012/03/steelers-awarded-three-2012-7th-round-compensatory-draft-picks/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:09:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:39:55+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mko9wl</id><link>http://www.steelersdepot.com/2012/03/steelers-awarded-three-2012-7th-round-compensatory-draft-picks/#comment-476672628</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
