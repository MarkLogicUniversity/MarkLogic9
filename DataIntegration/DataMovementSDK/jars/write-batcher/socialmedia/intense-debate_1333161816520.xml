And I'm a hopeless romantic. 

"Citizen Kane" was a brilliant film, but I've only watched it a few times in my entire life. "Casablanca" I watch once a year or so. It's like sitting down to your favorite meal in a comfortable chair wearing your plushest robe, with a fire Burning in the fireplace. 

And I still tear up every time at the scene at Rick's where the non-German ex-pats start singing "La Marseillaise". I'm old enough that my father fought in WWII (Pacific, not Europe, but still: Pearl Harbor, Guadalcanal, Guam), and I grew up with a keen sense of that conflict and how uncertain the outcome was to those who lived it. The film was made in 1941 -- before the US even got into the war -- and the lights were going out in Europe and along the Asian rim. I Always see the film in that light. ..bruce..</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zka8i</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/e862</id></website><link>http://www.lileks.com/bleats/archive/12/0312/033012.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T05:18:36+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:37:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwd8e8</id><link>http://www.lileks.com/bleats/archive/12/0312/033012.html#comment-480746234</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rqdcp</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
