Does shuttting your lights  at home and offices reduce the emission of CO2??? or reducing your carbon foot print??

The ANSWER is a BIG NO.. It remains the same.

It can ONLY be TRUE if what we SHUT  is the POWER PLANT, the source iof electricity in line..

It is the Power Plant which Burnt the FUEL that gives  the CO2 into the atmosphere.

But shutting  the Power Plant for One hour can cause a major mechanical damage to the machineneryÂ  at the power plant., the start-up is not that simple as re-staring the engine of your car.

Come on the so called bandweagon environmentalist, make up your mind, You can contribute to the reduction of your carbon footprint and the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere in so many ways, butÂ  the 60 minutes -light.

or tell NAPOCOR to shut Off .their POWER PLANTS for 60 minutes and I will be HAPPY.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/676a6b</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q15f</id></website><link>http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/169871/give-nature-a-little-rest-switch-off-lights-for-earth-hour-on-saturday-night</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:52:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:20:24+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwzyhb</id><link>http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/169871/give-nature-a-little-rest-switch-off-lights-for-earth-hour-on-saturday-night#comment-481035514</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/llg5p</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
