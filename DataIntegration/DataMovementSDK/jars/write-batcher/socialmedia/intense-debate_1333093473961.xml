I think she does a great job and Â would be great for thatÂ position when or it itÂ permanentlyÂ hers which I thinkÂ eventuallyÂ they are going to let Ann go andÂ bringÂ inÂ SavannahÂ toÂ replaceÂ her by this fall. Ann is better with Hard News and inÂ fieldÂ reporting like aÂ ForeignÂ correspondent.Â 

Also IÂ haveÂ notice some tension lately between NatalieÂ andÂ Savannah. Most of it comes from NaalieÂ towardsÂ Savannah. This morning was a good example with Savannah filling in forÂ AnnÂ when sheÂ tossedÂ to Natalie for the other news nicly, Natalie seemed kind of Cold and a bit testy with Savannah, Â Then when Natalie threwÂ backÂ to Savannah (Matt was down theÂ streetÂ because the next story was about the mega million and he was in aÂ deliÂ buying Â aÂ lotteryÂ and waiting for hisÂ segmentÂ to come) she was telling Savannah a story of something that happen in a nice, and Savannah wasÂ TestyÂ right back at Â back at Natalie and her tone was a little  when she didÂ thankÂ you unlike the nice tossing toÂ NatalieÂ just minutesÂ earlier. Â NatalieÂ seem mad about something.Â NatalieÂ isÂ probablyÂ not happy that she never fills in forÂ Ann alot latelyÂ and is Always getting pushed to the back by Savannah, Something is going on their and the Tension between them is starting to show which is sad because it seem like they were close and hot along great when she first joined. but that was justÂ weirdÂ how Savannah tried toÂ playÂ nice but then Natalie had this Cold tone in her voice and Savannah decided toÂ palÂ right back. Â How long until Natalie leaves? Â 
it's time that NBC/Today comes clean about really going on behind the scenes! Something is up Â andÂ something is going onÂ behind the scenes and it's is starting to show on camera! Something has not been right lately.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zqfo2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/eid</id></website><link>http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/morning-show-ratings-week-of-march-19-q1-2012_b118877</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:02:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:45:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m39bcf</id><link>http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/morning-show-ratings-week-of-march-19-q1-2012_b118877#comment-479932261</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/87c2k</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
