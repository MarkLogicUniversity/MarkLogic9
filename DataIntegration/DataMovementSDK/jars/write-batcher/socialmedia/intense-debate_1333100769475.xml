Of course, in typical liberal fashion you have everything sorted out by race. I simply see it as a tragedy when someone dies. More so if it is done unjustifiably. What is even a bigger tragedy than that is when someone is tried in the public court of opinion by a flash mob of people who fail to use reason because they have been taught only to react instead of think by a public education system that uses them as useful idiots. When you Act in that matter you are only adding fuel to the fire that seeks Burn you as well. Soon there will be no more "innocent until proven guilty". Do you know what that is Brad? Do you know what the constitution is Brad? Be careful of what you wish for because just because you think it wont apply to you because you support it, does not mean that tyranny will not get you too.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z7kut</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/o2bq</id></website><link>http://patriotupdate.com/articles/are-radicals-stirring-up-racial-conflict-to-overthrow-america</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:12:28+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:38:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3jxjo</id><link>http://patriotupdate.com/articles/are-radicals-stirring-up-racial-conflict-to-overthrow-america#comment-479978488</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/e8pl4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
