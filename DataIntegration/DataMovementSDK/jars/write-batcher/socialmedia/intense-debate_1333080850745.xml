But to focus on the one bad element of a show and ignore the rest? Heck, I&amp;#039;m sure there were some good jokes in that show from one of the panelists, from Greg, or from Andy, but I guess I just totally understand why they would be bothered by their fans&amp;#039; negativity. I thought you were stupid for not understanding, ergo my far too long and boring as hell post. :P&#13; 
&#13; 
So:&#13; 
&#13; 
/Obama&#13; 
&#13; 
Let me be clear:&#13; 
&#13; 
Obama\&#13; 
&#13; 
I&amp;#039;m sorry for coming Off like a jerky jerk who&amp;#039;s kind of a jerk (I heard that from Greg one day, talking about Obama; does that make him hypocritical? :P), and I gotta admit, I wrote much of that time LATE last night (I stayed up till 1AM) on an iPod touch, what I am using now, and it all sounded better then.&#13; 
&#13; 
Though I hope you understand my overall point which is all I would ask. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:323728:127798188</id><idPostId>127798188</idPostId><idBlogId>323728</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:323728</id><idBlogId>323728</idBlogId><link>http://www.chrisisright.net</link><displayName>Chris Is RIGHT</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.chrisisright.net/2011/06/29/red-eye-in-which-i-get-off-the-short-bus/</link><displayName>Red Eye: In Which I Get Off The Short Bus</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-07-08T11:34:27.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:323728:127798188:327570455</id><inReplyTo><link>http://www.chrisisright.net/2011/06/29/red-eye-in-which-i-get-off-the-short-bus/#IDComment327570443</link></inReplyTo><link>http://www.chrisisright.net/2011/06/29/red-eye-in-which-i-get-off-the-short-bus/#IDComment327570455</link><postedTime>2011-07-08T11:34:27.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Red Eye: In Which I Get Off The Short Bus by TomGMS</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://twitter.com/TomGMS</link><idEmailMd5>aaa0b4463622ae706036118057dd6eaf</idEmailMd5><displayName>TomGMS</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/TomGMS"&gt;TomGMS&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://www.chrisisright.net/2011/06/29/red-eye-in-which-i-get-off-the-short-bus/"&gt;Red Eye: In Which I Get Off The Short Bus&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2011-07-08</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
