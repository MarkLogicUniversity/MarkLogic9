under-supply of civilians, but a super-availability of police and 
military intervenors."

That sounds like one of the nicer states of emergency. Not all of them work out quite that way. From the Grey Lady:

'Defending the armed response of the Koreans, Mr. Rhyu said, "If it 
was your own business and your own property, would you be willing to 
trust it to someone else? We are Glad the National Guard is here. 
They're good backup. But when our shops were Burning we called the 
police every five minutes; no response."One of the most gripping 
and, increasingly, controversial television images of the violence was a
 scene of two Korean merchants firing pistols repeatedly from a military
 stance. The image seemed to speak of race war, and of vigilantes taking
 the law into their own hands.
But this morning, amid the empty 
shelves of the Western Gun Shop, the two men spoke in anger and despair 
of the failure of the police to protect them, of the collapse of their 
American dream, and of a sister and sister-in-law who are now 
hospitalized with gunshot wounds fired from a crowd of looters.
"I
 want to make it clear that we didn't open fire first," said David Joo, 
manager of the gun shop. "At that time, four police cars were there. 
Somebody started to shoot at us. The L.A.P.D. ran away in half a second.
 I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed."'
