I need to explain that  LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas) is propane and or butane both of which can be kept in liquid state by pressurization.  NG (natural gas) is basically methane and is used as a pressurized gas.  Methane cannot be kept in liquid form (LNG) except by keeping it extremely Cold (-256F).  It will boil  and the boil  is what is used as fuel.  The boil Off will continue and if not vented either as fuel or to a vent line, the pressure will climb until it ruptures the tank or fuel lines.  But I have touted it for years for use on over the road truckers and for rail road trains that keep their engines running almost 24/7.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lsewc</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ry2d</id></website><link>http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=50486</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T21:03:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:21:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3q3jz</id><link>http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=50486#comment-479620778</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ypeut</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
