Why?
I suspect that the Germanic, Spanish and Italian descendants of Â many of the Argentine Government ministers making all this fuss arrived long after the British settled the Falklands.
Should the FalklandersÂ be kicked Off the land that they have farmed and tended for generations?
Should their houses built by their grand parents be destroyed?
Should the English school books be Burnt?
Should they learn to drive on the right?
SOUNDS LIKE ETHNIC CLEANSING.
Should French Guyana (the size of Scotland) be handed to Portugese speaking Brazil despite the wishes of it's French Citizenry because it is actually in South America?
The Falklands should follow the lead of Hawaii (US),Alaska(US),La Reunion (Fra),Martinique(Fra),Guadeloupe(Fra) and Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (Dutch) in entering into fully fledged Union with the UK so as to be delisted as a "colony".</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/675fyd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/9176168/Falkland-Islands-will-belong-to-Argentina-one-day-says-minister.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:46:40+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T15:30:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw6454</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/9176168/Falkland-Islands-will-belong-to-Argentina-one-day-says-minister.html#comment-480860226</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cgw48</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
