Many churches turned away from the Bible a long time ago to Gain members.

Revelation 3

13 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
14 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;
15 I know thy works, that thou art neither Cold nor hot: I would thou wert Cold or hot.
16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither Cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.
17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:
18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and [that] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.
19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zalc3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t33k</id></website><link>http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/open-thread/blog-95/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T03:55:44+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T08:40:02+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3h03a</id><link>http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/open-thread/blog-95/#comment-479343637</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6521z</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
