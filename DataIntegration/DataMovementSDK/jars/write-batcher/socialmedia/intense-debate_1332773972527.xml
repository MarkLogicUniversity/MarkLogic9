that no one seems to have touched on. It concerns Obama&amp;#039;s seeming insensitivity to the unemployment crisis bedeviling black youth. Perhaps you recall over the summer when Maxine &amp;quot;Republicans are devils&amp;quot; Waters criticized Obama during one of his bus tours for not venturing into poor black neighborhoods. That betrayed a growing rift between Obama and congressional black leaders; it told us that disillusionment is setting in because Black Americans are worse Off today than when Obama took office. Indeed, with  black unemployment at 15.9% (the highest in the nation), and a catastrophic rate of 40% among black teenagers (see), Obama fears (and rightly so) that come Election Day many (too many) dispirited black voters will stay home. &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re getting tired,&amp;quot; said Waters of waiting for Obama to do something for &amp;quot;our people who are hurting.&amp;quot; And still nothing is being done as black unemployment remains at Depression levels and the hurt grows. &amp;quot;Hope and Change&amp;quot; is turning into hopelessness and pain as black expectations crash and Burn along with their fortunes.
