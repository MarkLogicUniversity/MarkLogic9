These double speak by our elite intelligencia, our shining star politicians, those war hawks, you &amp; me. It is where the blood dries &amp; where the specters and stench of the children, women, and men we have obliterated from this earth accumulates. 

The shame we create day after day, and still we ignore who we are, what we, the people have become the unnecessary horror &amp; inhumane tragedy we allow to be committed in OUR name. So the 2%ers can make more money,  more &amp; more power over us.

We, the people have  been real good at war. Any we've been in shows how serious we are at this craft, this art we exercise all over this world. There are no rational reasons to justify any thing we do anymore. It's  only about the money, and only the 2%ers money.

Pfc. Manning did violate his trust &amp; should pay for that with an open public trial. He should be convicted for his security violation, only. He knew what he was doing &amp; the cost it would be. Taking it like the man he showed himself to be, have you noticed he doesnâ€™t whimper. Then pardoned by whoever is President at the time. 

Pfc. Bradley Manning is a real hero, seems he showed more bravery &amp; manly courage then.... a whole lot of us, huh? He did what he could, because he had no other choice, not for the glory. Do we? Ever?

The Nobel Peace award, Our President Obama should relinquish as a matter of honor for the things he has done, not done &amp; allowed. I'd see that as proper, courageous too. A true  of honor.

Say a prayer for all of us &amp; those not of us. I have since 911; the writing was on the wall way back then, in capital letters for any brave enough to admit it. We, the people's actions &amp; inactions brought all this about, made it so, nothing else.

Our national lack of honor, courage to rage openly against these atrocities exemplifies our continuing failings, Wall St.â€™s rape &amp; pillage of our economy by the very few, the needless relentless incarceration of our own citizenry, this malignant disregard for the individual by the 2%ers as voiced by our congress as acceptable &amp; correct in the â€˜deficitâ€™ crisis BS justifications, for the acceptance of the casual nonchalant devaluing of simple liberty, the double speak, etc. 

Hard to admit failings, anger is easier to shunt at the easiest available scapegoats and whipping boys. Seems, We, the people find blaming real easy too.

We, the people placed all these players into these situations, all they've done is fulfilled their parts in our history the way theyâ€™re suppose to. So some of us are damaged goods now, the 2%ers can figure a way to make a buck  them still.

Honor can be easily lost but true honor can be regained, earned back. â€˜We, the peopleâ€™, mystical as we pretend that define is, are only human beings, flawed, lacking, vile, sometimes even glorious, and true. And as humans we screwed up bad, yet our history never stops or slows down. Pushing us forward to tomorrows we can either face with trepidation, Anxiety, fear or with courage &amp; fortitude.

Nor, did our obligation or ability to make this nation better ever change. 

Even though this particular article is about Pfc. Manning, it is about &amp; connected to all the other stuff going on. Nothing in this society is ever disconnected or singular, itâ€™s  about the money, only the 2%ersâ€™ moneyâ€¦ so far. Why not about yours and mine?

When I was in a shooting war in a far away land, it wasnâ€™t my President or congressman, General or any of the 2%ers next to me dodging the bullets and doing the killing. It was/is just the guys from the neighborhoods. 

Realized then &amp; there it wasnâ€™t America that does war real good, it is me &amp; you. The common man, the citizen. Only difference in the battlefield is this oncoming one,  before our very eyes is here on my land, my country. Our America.

This war must not be fought against America, but for America. 

The 2%ers are busy setting it up, to believe their dribble that whatâ€™s coming is against America. They want &amp; need us to be against America, they lose when it is only for our America that we, the citizen, war. 

The 2%ers are starting to really fear the We, the people part of us. Already theyâ€™ve driven 50% of us into poverty, and they not done yet. But they projected weâ€™d go blindly into their sheds for their blood sucking climax. The unfettered gorging theyâ€™ve longed as the power for. 

Ever read this? This is what this is all about.

â€œWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their dutyâ€¦â€&#157;

Our Government does work, donâ€™t ever forget that, it is the We, the people that havenâ€™t for awhile. It is time. Girth you &amp; yours, be brave, maintain our honor. Be glorious, be brave. Know there is Always a price to pay. Pfc. Manning knew there was &amp; pays. 

Those without honor know not what I speak. 

There, I did it again! Put that in your data base a hundred times. You should fear me I'm an American.

God don't bless America! WE, the people ... DO!
