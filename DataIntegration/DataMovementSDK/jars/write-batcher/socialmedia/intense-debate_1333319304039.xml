Has no one in middle earth heard of Heat radiation. That&amp;#039;s friggin LAVA. 
The night after I first saw fellowship of the ring, the weekend it came out, I had a nightmare where the ringwraiths were chasing me as a Ms PacMan 
The ringwraith voices are even creepier when you have only one earbud working. 
Hi Rosie!

this is the part where you scream and run Frodo 
If, when I get engaged, my sig other proposes with an engraven one ring, I will love them forever! 
Props to Serkis. That looked like it hurt. 
Great and Terrible? Like SMeyer and books, right? 
Sam just wants a , Gandalf! 
So you heard the entire conversation then 
But not foundry&amp;#039;d 
Scarecrow, you are not working! 
More singing. It&amp;#039;s not as annoying in A/V form. 
drooling at set design for orthanc
