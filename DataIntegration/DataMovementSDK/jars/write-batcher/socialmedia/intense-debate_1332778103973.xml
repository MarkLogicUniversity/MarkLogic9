(Bars, the grocery, whatevz.) And when I quit I realised why I did it so much: it was  either an excuse to talk to someone ("do you have a light?" --my main pickup line) or a reason not to ("uh, i'm gonna go outside for a smoke, seeya creepy dude.")Â  Or a reason to leave a stressful situation -- "I need to stand outside alone for seven minutes and collect myself so I don't tear your fucking head Off" doesn't fly as well as "I need a cigarette, brb."Â  And it's something to do with your hands in otherwise awkward situations -- it was the primary social crutch for my Anxiety-riddled brain.Â  And figuring out alternatives to those habits was a major part of stopping, though I also think I just might not have developed a serious chemical addiction judging by how easily I quit?
