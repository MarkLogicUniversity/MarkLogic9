They prefer expensive Hawiian vacations, eating fine steaks (Gaining waight were it shows), and shooting lots of golf.Â  Michelle's reckless spending of taxpayer money would make the French Bourbon Kings Blush with envy.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6y4xps</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/o6hq</id></website><link>http://conservativebyte.com/2012/03/obama-caught-fibbing-at-oil-field/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T13:39:12+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T15:18:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi264c</id><link>http://conservativebyte.com/2012/03/obama-caught-fibbing-at-oil-field/#comment-473665323</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cmxj2</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
