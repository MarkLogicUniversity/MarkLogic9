My before &amp; current picture: http://www.theworldaccordingtoeggface.com the 158 pound Weight loss I achieved  all my health issues Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea, High Blood Pressure, and a host of other issues, I am  all 8 medications I was on prior to surgery, I have not been to the doctor for anything more than routine check-ups in 5 years. Best decision I ever made but having surgery was just one battle in a lifetime war versus obesity, every day I wake up and fight with healthy eating choices, moving my body and the most important in my opinion: working on the head, addressing the reasons I Gained weight. I encourage readers thinking about Weight loss surgery to research, talk to your doctor, attend a bariatric seminar, hit up post-ops about their experience. It's not the right choice for everyone but it was for me and thousands and thousands of others. Best wishes to Carnie and everyone in their efforts to get healthy no matter how they need to do it. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6y8ljc</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/03/21/carnie-wilson-undergoes-weight-loss-surgery-for-second-time/</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T21:37:12+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T05:43:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mpop7e</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/03/21/carnie-wilson-undergoes-weight-loss-surgery-for-second-time/#comment-473316594</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/y553w</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
