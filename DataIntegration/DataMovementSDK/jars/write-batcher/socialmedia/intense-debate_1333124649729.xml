2. Team Johnny Ace wins
3. the diva's tag match. and not a single F___k was given. (Beth Phoenix kills all three participants until Madusa comes and destroys Phoenix)
4. Kane vs. AWOL Orton. See number 3. Not a single F___ was given
5. Bryan Danielson retains the title over Sheamus. YES!! YES!! YES!!
6. Undertaker wins. 20-0 until the next night on RAW we see the return of Brock Lesnar or STONE COLD!! STONE COLD!! STONE COLD!!
7. CM Punk vs. Chris Jericho. damn, I can't pick either of the two...
8. As much as I hate to admit this, the WWE has booked cena to win.
Until Lord Tensai (A-Train) comes along with Togi Makabe, Tanahashi, and the rest of the NJPW roster comes and destroys the wwe and cena.
Tyler Black, the Kings or Wrestling, Jon Moxley, Bo Rotundo, and Husky Harris comes and cleans house. 

Then turns their back on the wwe and forms their own version of THE NEXUS.
