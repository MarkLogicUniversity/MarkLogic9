Almost one year ago I was 8 weeks pregnant and having stomach cramps. After a few hours of pain, we called my OBGYN. As it was after hours when we called, we got her call center. They paged my Dr.'s on call who returned my call with in 10 minutes. He advised us to get to the ER soon as it appeared I was having a miscarriage. Thus began the nightmare of our Tarzana, CA ER experience. We arrived at 11:45pm to a full waiting room. After telling the gal behind the glass our problem, she said, "have a seat, we will be with you soon". Soon turned into 45 minutes. Pain and embarrassment is an understatement. Finally my husband and I were called into a nursing station. My vitals were checked, I was asked on a scale of 1-10 my pain (believe I said 6 at that time) and we were sent back into the waiting room. 
That 6 jumped above 10 with in minutes of joining the posse in the waiting room. As I started to pass out, sweat and whisper to my husband 'Jeff..I'm going to throw up..help me", he ran to the gal behind the glass begging for help. She explained to him, "we are waiting for some beds to be clean so we can get you wife to a bed." She then handed him a Vomit bag. That was a low for my husband as he pleaded for help and a 'clean bed' and me as I tried to avoid attention from the waiting room posse as I poured sweat down my body and faded in and out of consciousness.  
Finally, I'd say a mere 1 1/2 hours after arriving in the waiting room, my name was called. As I stood up, I passed out in pain. My husband and two nurses carried me to a bed.  My new home for 8 hours. (What mishaps happened there is a separate note and frustration on what I thought was emergency care for someone in emergent need.)
Back to the billing nightmare...
I spent 8 hours in that ER bed. Clearly I was having a painful miscarriage, but not one person would tell us what was going on. I was charged for an ER nurse, ER doctor and ultrasound tech as well as the room we were being held in. The ER Dr never made it to my bedside. Around 7:30am, the ER doctor finally arrived, he had told us the results of the ultrasound, no heart beat. This much we had figured after 8 hours of lying in my own blood and on morphine to stop me from screaming in pain. May I just add this, sure the devastation of loosing an 8-week fetus is awful, but more so is being so left in the dark. Not one nurse, Dr or what have you would offer one ounce of information, water, blanket, etc..
After our 7:30am meeting with the ER doctor, who we had not met prior, we decided a DNC surgery was needed. Note, at this point, neither my husband nor I had one second of sleep. I was wheeled up stairs around 8:00am and underwent the 1-2 hour surgery. 
Sorry for the long story..But here is where Tarzana hospital completely messed up the bill. 
I was wheeled to a hospital room around 9:30/10 am. My husband was there and I was told to sleep for a bit. He left as we had two children still at home. I was awaked often to have my vitals check by the attending nurse. Upon my first time waking up, I asked, "when can I go home?â€&#157; I asked this every time after that and was told the same answer. "The doctor needs to see you first, just keep resting until he comes. He needs to see you in order for you to be released".
I was so tired; I accepted this and just kept falling back asleep. 
Around 4pm, my husband woke me up. He asked for the nurse to come in. When we asked when the good Dr. was planning to come, we've been waiting all day; she explained she would go call him.
She returned with in 10 minutes and said, "oh..the Dr. was surprised you were still here! I guess he doesn't need to see you. He just told me you were free to go once you woke up". Mind you I 'woke up' over 6 hours ago. 

So, the bill.
I was charged for being in all three places at once. The ER room, the surgery prep and surgery room and a private hospital room! The private hospital room I didn't need to be in. Over $3,000 for a room I didn't need, the Dr even told the uniformed nurse that. 
I received the notice from my insurance company, the 'this is not a bill', which spells out what you should expect soon from a bill. Total charges were $25,000! I next received a bill from Tarzana hospital. Minus insurance coverage, they claimed I owed them $5,000. There was not one bit of detail to my bill. Just claimed the 5k was pass due and due ASAP. I called and asked for a detailed bill, explaining I will not pay a bill with out details and explanation to what I'm being charged for.

Weeks later, we received a detailed out bill. What a joke in more ways than one. Scary how they must have customers that don't ask to see the bill in detail, can pay blindly. How can you pay a bill with out seeing what you are paying for? 
I think I answered my own question here....once I took a hard close look at the bill, I realized I was being charged basically room and board for three different places all at the same time.

I was already sour with the absurd treatment of my husband and I while in the ER, but to then be handed a bill that made no sense just made it all not add up. And really, $25,000 for an ER visit and DNC surgery? 

I called the billing department with exact times for when I was in each room, and being seen by each doctor. They documented all I had to say and told me my $25,000 bill was going into arbitration. I would be notified once there was a decision.

Here is the silver lining in this massive ER nightmare. I got a call 6 months later saying it was all cleared up. The charges for the rooms and Dr.'s I was clearly not in or using were taken Off. All said and done, I didn't pay a dime.

I can't help but think, in a terrible situation that brings you our your loved one to an ER, to not have the energy nor knowledge to challenge an unjust bill...how many people have just bent over and paid it. 

There is a clear problem with our ER system and the billing.
