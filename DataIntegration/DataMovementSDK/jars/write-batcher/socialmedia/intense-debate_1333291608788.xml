My Anxiety about that is that I don't think we can put him on rehab without putting him on the 40-man roster first -- at which point his escape clause is nullified, but he gets an immediate raise to $1.5M and, once he comes  rehab, becomes another of those play-'em-or-waiver-'em Immovable Objects on the active roster. Of course we Reach that crunch anyway on May 1 with the escape clause; but I think it's best to defer these irrevocable commitments as far into the season as possible.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67v6dg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27768988%26vkey=news_bos%26c_id=bos</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:04:36+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T08:22:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwj7zt</id><link>http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27768988%26vkey=news_bos%26c_id=bos#comment-481649849</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/csz32</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
