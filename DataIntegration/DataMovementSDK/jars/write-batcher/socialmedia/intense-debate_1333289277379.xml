Vodafone wanted to make money Off Indias growing mobile phone users and they found a tax loophole and made use of it. The Indian government understood the magnitude of revenue lost and has plugged the loophole.

Vodaphone must COUGH OUT the money now. The other option is ,it can quitely leave India.

India doesnt need vodafone, but vodafone and many other companies like it need India for their survival. Period !

We are not very much worried about foreign investment from the UK... there are many other countries in the que waiting to do legitimate and honest business with us rather then cunningly profit from a tax loophole.

I hope this clarifies the minds of the deluded !!!!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/675r8j</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/9176154/India-could-face-constitutional-crisis-over-tax-proposals.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:28:09+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T07:31:21+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw9ihn</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/9176154/India-could-face-constitutional-crisis-over-tax-proposals.html#comment-481622600</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8m3vx</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
