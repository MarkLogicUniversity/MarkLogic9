Until you have watched a person in a vegatative state receive dialysis and kept alive on a ventilator while developing huge bed sores, you have no idea what you are talking about. I've been doing this 20 years and have yet to see a viable person with brain waves "starved to death" or denied a drink of water."

KSRN, I respect the point of your post, but my own experience was different.Â  The doctors convinced my mother-in-law to starve her sisterÂ to death.Â  Her sister had just experienced a stroke.Â  She absolutely had "viable brain waves," but she was old.Â  My mother-in-lawÂ was told that depriving her sister of waterÂ would be painless, that she would just drift Off to sleep.

After a lot of research, I now believe that it was completeÂ baloney.Â  Dehydration can be an excruciatingly painful way to die, and there was evidence that her sister suffered terribly before the end finally came.Â  Texas Futile Care law sounds good on the surface, but saving money is the dark motive here.

If you review my posting history here, you will find that I am no fan of Bud Kennedy.Â  But he got this one right.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r5pzv</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmw</id></website><link>http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/03/24/3833274/texas-has-had-death-panels-since.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T04:18:36+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:28:41+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkuqos</id><link>http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/03/24/3833274/texas-has-had-death-panels-since.html#comment-476430080</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/duzjf</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
