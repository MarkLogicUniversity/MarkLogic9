Ron Paul's non-intervention policy is the geography analogue to denying evolution.  Our world is interconnected and what happens over there affects us here.  Straight of Hormuz, the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, Panama Canal, Straight of Mallaca, Formosa, et al are all chokepoints that are bordered by unstable or antagonistic governments.  All of our commerce passes through these strategic areas or the commerce of our friends to whom we Depend for trade.  Ron Paul is idealistic, anachronistic, and dangerous to the prosperity of this country.
His domestic fiduciary ideas are Spot on...except the whole gold standard thing.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r1t8o</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/h432</id></website><link>http://cw.ua.edu/2012/03/26/ron-paul-is-the-only-one-we-can-trust/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T05:17:02+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:36:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mko13m</id><link>http://cw.ua.edu/2012/03/26/ron-paul-is-the-only-one-we-can-trust/#comment-476669995</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hl0va</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
