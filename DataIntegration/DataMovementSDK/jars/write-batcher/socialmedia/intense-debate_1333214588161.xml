Â 
Plus the energy companies  offer the best deal toÂ entice customers to them, then shortly afterwards put up their prices higher than other companies. Further more they all reduce their prives in spring summer when consumption is lowest(ie. no Heating on and greater length of daylight), then hike their pricesÂ really high onceÂ autum/winter comes when they all know our consumption is highest(Heating and increased nighttime periods). 

Maybe 38 degrees would be better  concentrating on pushing politicians into making businesses turn  all un-necessaryÂ energy consumptionÂ at night time, when people are not purchasing products they so love to display.Â And councils to shut down all un-necessary energy in their buildings and park and rides, which seem to be lite up like christmas trees at night time.Councils also need to invest in a lighting system that works on a security light basis, with sensors that lightÂ up 2 or 3 lamp-postsÂ when they sense the movement of people or vehicles. But will switch OffÂ again when no movement is detected after 60/120 seconds.

Because reducing consumption on a mass scale will reduce the need for these so called safe; clean nuclear power plants; it would also reduce the price we all pay as a whole as the need for energy is so called priced on an as needed basis(the more we need the greater the cost.Â Â
