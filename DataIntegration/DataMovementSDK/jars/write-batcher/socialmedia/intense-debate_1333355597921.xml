then Daesung.
not really feeling GD's look in BAD BOY.

in FANTASTIC BABY...
OMFG!!! TOP's eyebrows!!! PINK!!! O.O

ONLY TOP could get away with that look!!! [maybe GD too.... ]
soooooo eccentric! but he pulled it  pretty well! i'm impressed!

i like how each member had a particular color...
so... ranked in order of looks....
for me: #1. GD! gorgeous! i loved the glitter eye make up... and that's my fave Â outfit from the vid :]

Â #2. Daesung! he  looks beautiful in a suit and that particular color really compliments his complexion &amp; his hair color! &lt;3

#3. Taeyang! [possibly a biased rank :P] i think after being exposed to so much of his skin &amp; arms lately...it's nice to see him COMPLETELY CLOTHED! Â ROFL! XD [what kinda Taeyang stan am i??? XP]

#4. TOP! "watermelon fashion" as it is being so appropriately called :PÂ 
just what the summer Heat needed &lt;3 he should actually rank higher, in the #2 Spot for DARING, &amp; ECCENTRICITY bcz i think that it was an incredibly crazy look that he pulled  smhow. but as i find it a lil weird for my conventional taste... he ranked low. but definitely earns my awe &amp; respect! &lt;3

#5. Seungri. i really adore Baby Ri &amp; his never-ending quest to  maturity :P so i like that he's experimenting. i like the all red. he looks great. my only prob was... the red leather pants were too tight, so they put me Off a bit. and in this particular vid, maknae was upstaged by his gorgeous hyungs! better luck next time Ri! you ranked #1 for me in this BAD BOY vid, so dnt be sad! :P</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vzjko</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/g1xx</id></website><link>http://www.bigbangupdates.com/2012/04/bigbangs-inkigayo-performances-120401.html</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T10:06:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T07:29:34+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0jv20</id><link>http://www.bigbangupdates.com/2012/04/bigbangs-inkigayo-performances-120401.html#comment-483330275</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lj366</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
