I suspect that since they had not managed to achieve the predicted Weight loss, they lost heart and terminated the programme by saying they had Reached their desired weight.
At the end of the day, the only person they would be cheating was themselves.
I did get a reply, the top losers list is generated automatically-it doesn't question validity of the information. There is a possibility that this will be replaced with a 'plans to watch' section. Judging by that string of green Spots you've got going on, you could be one to watch!!
Debs.
