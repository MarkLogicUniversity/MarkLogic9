(Telling him this what he deserved being a white %$#.)  Luckily, he was able to pull  his shirt and only experience first degree Burns to his face and arms. This story never got beyond Kansas City and died in one day. The thugs have not been charged because they are minors..17 year olds..his mother is now forced to leave KC and move to Blue Springs to keep him safe...I wonder if Obama called her to apologize for the black criminal Acts...that white boy looked a lot like "my son"..</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67tcrx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rlyt</id></website><link>http://visiontoamerica.org/8973/al-sharpton-encourages-increased-civil-disobedience/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:53:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T19:17:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0azbc</id><link>http://visiontoamerica.org/8973/al-sharpton-encourages-increased-civil-disobedience/#comment-482115387</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
