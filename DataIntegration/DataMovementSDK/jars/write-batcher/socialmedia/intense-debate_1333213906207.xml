We complained to our city councilwoman, who talked to the people.Â  They refused to shut down.Â  She then took them to court, which shut them down immediately.

Obviously, I am very Glad we have zoning.Â  Negative externalities can be huge.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67yd9j</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/eyjq</id></website><link>http://m.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/affordable-housing-and-social-engineering-in-new-jersey/255269/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:16:09+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T19:54:02+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwv6mr</id><link>http://m.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/affordable-housing-and-social-engineering-in-new-jersey/255269/#comment-481129895</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/adp9q</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
