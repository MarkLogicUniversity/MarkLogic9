Maybe she can warm over some of the Cold liberal day show watchers.  She&amp;#039;s never had a fair shake from people who are only exposed to the liberal media.  NBC might be making a mistake here if they want to keep the propaganda going. 
 
We have two radio stations owned by the same conglomerate in the SF bay area.   One has  been left leaning (to different degrees) and the other has Always been right leaning (Rush/Hannity/Lavin type). 
 
In the beginning of the year they had a remake on both stations.  The conservative station included more local talent (Melanie Morgan is back YEA!) but remains conservative.   The Liberal station (called the &amp;quot;News&amp;quot; station) has reconstructed their talents to include about 1/2 of the show talents being conservative. 
 
I think media realizing that in order to survive, they have to start serving the majority of their potential audience and put on some conservative talent. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:322782:127985663</id><idPostId>127985663</idPostId><idBlogId>322782</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:322782</id><idBlogId>322782</idBlogId><link>http://www.navygentleman.com/political</link><displayName>Conservative Victory 2012</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.navygentleman.com/political/?p=2752</link><displayName>Exclusive - Palin to Couric: 'Game On'</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-01T03:19:41.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:322782:127985663:328944754</id><link>http://www.navygentleman.com/political/?p=2752#IDComment328944754</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T03:19:41.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Exclusive - Palin to Couric: 'Game On' by Billyb9</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://intensedebate.com/people/Billyb9</link><idEmailMd5>ab1669d33bb74b90415759e309e29164</idEmailMd5><displayName>Billyb9</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/people/Billyb9"&gt;Billyb9&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://www.navygentleman.com/political/?p=2752"&gt;Exclusive - Palin to Couric: 'Game On'&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
