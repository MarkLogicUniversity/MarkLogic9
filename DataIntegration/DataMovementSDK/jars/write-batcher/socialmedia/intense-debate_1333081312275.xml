Single analog controls with stylus = Discomfort + more precisionÂ 

This seems to be the consensus. And you're right about Sony and MS. They would be Burning with hate comments if they did the same thing. But knowing that you have played the game you'd have to agree that for a game with such fast pace as this one has, the stylus precision is going to be your best bet. Slow the tempo of the game down, then dual analog would be the way to go. But then again, if the tempo was slowed down, would the game be as exiting as it is now? Besides, you even said yourself. Controls do get easier with time. Some, like myself, need more time than others to get adjusted. But once I did, it was second nature. The discomfort came from me not being adjusted to the control scheme. Once I found my comfortable gaming position, all the discomfort seemed to Vanish. So please don't let the controls prevent you from trying this game out. I finished the game last night and was not disappointed! Instant Classic!!!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ly8u2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7d9s</id></website><link>http://ds.ign.com/articles/122/1221614p1.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T23:59:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:56:23+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m31yzd</id><link>http://ds.ign.com/articles/122/1221614p1.html#comment-479822480</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/goj13</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
