Zimmerman may be guilty of putting himself in a bad Spot. He may 
be guilty of murder. While trying to protect a community. Who knows.Â  It
 sure beats all of the murders committed this week that weren't by 
accident or aggravated performed mostly by which group? Gee I wonder.

You won't see Al Sharpton showing up to any black assaults or murders this week I guarantee that though. Hypocrisy at it's best.
