1. Holy Family in WFB has Always been a LPI customer.
2. St George Publishing has 6 employee at the time of their failure.  They did NO website updates.
3. JS Paluch and Steven Karides have entered into a backroom agreement.  JS Paluch got advance notice of the closing and attempted to sign as many accounts as they could.  In exchange, Karides is receiving a portion of the revenues.  Remember, on ALL these bulletins advertisers who paid for a YEAR of ads.  St George should have refunded their money or not sold annual ads.  They did not just realize on 2/20/12 that they could not make it.
4. St George forced almost all of their churches into new contracts in the last 24 months that drastically cut the churches take on the ads.  
5.  Anonymous sources should tell you everything you need to know.  Those who wanted to make a change are the ones taking all the Heat in this.  The transition has been less than smooth for many and horrid for a number of parishes.
