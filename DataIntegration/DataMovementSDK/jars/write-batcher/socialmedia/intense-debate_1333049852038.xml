Yes he DID stated that he wanted to break free from the conventional idol-agent whatever, and it's clear that's the sole reason why he breaked Off with Woolim &amp; formed Map the Soul.Â 

BUT.. Since Tajinyo/Stanford case, ughh come on.. Let's be real here. He's a father now, head of a family, he need money to feed their family okay.. He NEEDS the power of YG to comeback. So seriously, put yourself in his shoes. Be realistic. If he were to release Fever's End on his independent label, will he able to release it?? He needs the funding, PR power, marketing power of YG.Â 

Plus, I believe his contract should be similar to PSY. Basically YG will handle the management &amp; marketing side, while giving the artist the freedom to do music etc.Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/m141d7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/nou3</id></website><link>http://seoulbeats.com/2011/11/review-fevers-end-tablo/</link><postedTime>2011-11-07T20:01:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-11-08T13:54:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/g3ljhj</id><link>http://seoulbeats.com/2011/11/review-fevers-end-tablo/#comment-358353567</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-11-07</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
