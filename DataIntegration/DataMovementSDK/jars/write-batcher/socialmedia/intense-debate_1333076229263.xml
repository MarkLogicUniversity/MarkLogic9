Where else would a devoted audience sit through seemingly endless commercials for the Hoodie-Footie, Shiatsu Pillow Massager, exercise gizmos/torture devices, and we can&amp;#039;t forget catheters!&#13; 
&#13; 
How many other shows can say they are being watched and live tweeted at 3 a.m. EST?! The question of &amp;quot;Sleep or Red Eye&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#039;t even warrant an answer unless you are a pilot, nuclear scientist, school bus driver or any vocation where the public&amp;#039;s safety is involved.&#13; 
&#13; 
If Fox wanted to promote the IPad app they should have had Greg Gutfeld and company do a segment on it! While that could have a chance to backfire, if Fox truly believes it is a viable app, they would have put it through a true test. Heck, I have lib friends who have that app now so it can&amp;#039;t be all bad if they are willing to step into Murdoch territory.&#13; 
&#13; 
Thank you, Chris, for yet another awesome post. Hopefully Fox will hear our pleas and maybe we can eat at the adult table in the near future. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:323728:127795657</id><idPostId>127795657</idPostId><idBlogId>323728</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:323728</id><idBlogId>323728</idBlogId><link>http://www.chrisisright.net</link><displayName>Chris Is RIGHT</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.chrisisright.net/2011/02/03/an-open-letter-to-fox-news-regarding-red-eye/</link><displayName>An Open Letter to Fox News Regarding \"Red Eye\"</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-02-05T10:04:59.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:323728:127795657:327536471</id><link>http://www.chrisisright.net/2011/02/03/an-open-letter-to-fox-news-regarding-red-eye/#IDComment327536471</link><postedTime>2011-02-05T10:04:59.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on An Open Letter to Fox News Regarding \"Red Eye\" by Poligrrl</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link/><idEmailMd5>07b911ea3ee43e08faf42153f20872b7</idEmailMd5><displayName>Poligrrl</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>Poligrrl commented on &lt;a href="http://www.chrisisright.net/2011/02/03/an-open-letter-to-fox-news-regarding-red-eye/"&gt;An Open Letter to Fox News Regarding \"Red Eye\"&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2011-02-05</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
