The very idea of capitalism is that those that have money -Gain money. Since money is finite(As in not infinite, mind you). When one man gets richer, others gets poorer.

In a modern socialist country this is controlled by taxes on wealth which can give free education, healthcare etc for a common growth for the whole country, not just a select few.
This seems to work well in countries like Germany, Sweden, Finland etc that still has a strong economy with a healthy industry.

Try to look outside foxnews. Read a book that has been published after the Cold war.
