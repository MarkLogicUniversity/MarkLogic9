Â Beyond the fact that there is not even a bruise on this guy let alone any sign of lacerations, he claimed to have had his head banged on the concrete. Â You would surely have symptoms of concussion ( Dizziness, Nausea, Disorientation, unsteadiness ). Â There is no sign of anything of the kind. Â And, if he is telling the truth, there would have to be. Â He practically jumps out of the police car, steady on his feet and apparently unconcerned. Â He has just shot an unarmed 17 year-old to death by his account during a struggle for his own life and he looks about as concerned as if it were a traffic ticket.Â 
Having your unprotected brain slammed around in your skull is no small thing. Â People have died from such occurrences. Â Yet the police did not take him to the hospital. Â At this point, this case reeks.Â 
I believe it was the boy, Martin, on the ground screaming for help. Â Not Zimmerman. Â As far as I'm concerned, even the police investigation is tainted at this point and this needs to be taken over by the Feds. Â I think racial animus could be established by the facts of the investigation ( or lack thereof ) as known to this point and by the fact that his calls to 911 involving 'suspicious' people in the neighborhood Always, without exception, involved black youth.
