Lord Harris tweeted: "This woman was following advice from Govt Minister Francis Maude &amp; ends up with 40% Burns. Disgraceful. He shd resign.""

Was she following advice to pour petrol from a van to a jug next to a naked flame?Â 

Do we Â know she had fuel stored on the advice of Maude or for another reason?

How many people might suffered injury if we hadn't Acted rationally to reduce the risk of running out of fuel?

Perhaps it is Lord Harris who should go...at least keep his thoughts to himself.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z0h5h</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mxvm</id></website><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/woman-sets-fire-to-herself-decanting-petrol-7602990.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T08:57:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T19:58:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwvhdt</id><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/woman-sets-fire-to-herself-decanting-petrol-7602990.html#comment-481133825</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c10i1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
