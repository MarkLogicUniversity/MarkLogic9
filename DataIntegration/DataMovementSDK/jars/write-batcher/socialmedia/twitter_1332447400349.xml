Did you really read the link you posted?

Where did Masters say anything about "global warming" or "global"?

Did you miss this part about the cause of the warm spell? 

&lt;i&gt;The jet stream pattern features a large, southwards dipping bulge over the Western U.S., creating a trough of low pressure with Cold and snow, and a large, northwards looping bulge over the Central U.S., creating a record-strength ridge of high pressure. The Western U.S. trough has cut  into a "cut-Off low" that is slowly drifting eastwards.&lt;/i&gt;
What does your link say about whatâ€™s it like on the other side of that jet steam in Alaska and the NW coast?

&lt;i&gt;Remarkable late-season snow storm on West Coast&lt;/i&gt;

Since Masters talks only about approx 2% of the globe, whatâ€™s it like in the other 98%?

Then thereâ€™s the ultra progressive Romm who says it is â€œglobal warmingâ€&#157; causing the unusual warm winter in the US but ignores the global data.

&lt;i&gt; DID THEY LOOK AT ACTUAL GLOBAL DATA which is showing a Colder than normal March globally, a Colder than normal year so far globally, a 3 year retreat in global temps , before making such statements and if so , how do they blame it being warm in one place when its Cold, and getting Colder everywhere else, on the OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE ACTUAL DATA SHOWS.&lt;/i&gt;

Personally I donâ€™t believe that if you read it you surely donâ€™t understand it.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yv6r6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yzh7</id></website><link>http://blogs.kansas.com/weblog/2012/03/kancare-bidders-scrambling-to-sign-up-providers/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T11:34:46+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:08:22+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi5rp3</id><link>http://blogs.kansas.com/weblog/2012/03/kancare-bidders-scrambling-to-sign-up-providers/#comment-473853669</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/0uie</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
