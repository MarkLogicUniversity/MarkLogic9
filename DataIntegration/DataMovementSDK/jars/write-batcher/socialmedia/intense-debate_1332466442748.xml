The liberal media appears to be circling like sharks around a neighborhood watch captain, who claims to have shot a 17 year old Black in self-defense. The liberal media is describing the Black as a â€œboyâ€&#157; and claiming that he only weighs â€œ140 lbsâ€&#157;. Pictures of him when he was several years younger are being circulated as if theyâ€™re recent.
The 17 year old Black, Trayvon Martin, was visiting his father in a gated community. Itâ€™s not clear why the father didnâ€™t allow Trayvon to live with him. Perhaps, there was a reason for that.
The Miami Herald reports â€œCollege students around Florida rallied Monday to demand the arrest of a neighborhood watch captain who shot an unarmed black teen last month, though authorities may be hamstrung by a state law that allows people to defend themselves with deadly force.â€&#157; 
â€œPolice have described the man who fired the shot, 28-year-old George Zimmerman, as white; his family says he is Hispanic and is not racist.â€&#157;
â€œZimmerman claims he shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last month in self-defense during a confrontation in a gated community in Sanford.â€&#157;
â€œStudents held rallies on the campus of Florida A&amp;M University in Tallahassee and outside the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center, where prosecutors are reviewing the case to determine if charges should be filed. The students demanded Zimmermanâ€™s arrest.â€&#157;
â€œZimmerman Spotted Martin as he was patrolling his neighborhood on a rainy evening last month and called 911 to report a suspicious person. Against the advice of the 911 dispatcher, Zimmerman then followed Martin, who was walking home from a convenience store with a bag of Skittles in his pocket.â€&#157;
â€œâ€¦.The case has garnered national attention and civil rights activist Al Sharpton and radio host Michael Baisden planned to lead another rally Thursday in Sanford.â€&#157;
â€œU.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla., along with members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have asked that the U.S. Department of Justice to review the case, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday during a briefing that officials there were aware of what happened.â€&#157;
Nowhere in the Miami Herald do they mention key facts that cast this incident in a completely different light. 
An article in the UK Daily Mail reports â€œZimmerman told police officers that he had shot Martin and officers found a semiautomatic handgun on him. The report said that Zimmermanâ€™s back was wet and he was covered in grass as if he had been on the ground. He was Bleeding from his nose and the back of the head, the report said. A police officer said he overheard Zimmerman say, â€˜I was yelling for someone to help me but no one would help meâ€™ while he was being treated by paramedics.â€&#157;
Why arenâ€™t the liberal news sites mentioning that Zimmerman was Bleeding from the nose and the back of the head? Could it be that theyâ€™re trying to stir up a mob of ill-informed liberals to lynch what they thought was a White person?
Another news article reports on the 911 call: 
â€œâ€™This guy looks like heâ€™s up to no good, or heâ€™s on drugs or something,â€™ Zimmerman tells the 911 operator. â€˜Heâ€™s just staring, looking at all the houses. Now heâ€™s coming toward me. Heâ€™s got his hand in his waistband. Somethingâ€™s wrong with him.â€™â€&#157;
â€œZimmerman described Martin as wearing a hoodie and sweatpants or jeans. He continues: â€˜Heâ€™s coming to check me out. Heâ€™s got something in his hands. I donâ€™t know what his deal is. Can we get an officer over here?â€™â€&#157;
Virtually all the news media articles leave out the above portion of the 911 call. Add to that, the fact that it was raining, and the Black 17 year old was taking the time to case the houses in the neighborhood. Could it be that liberals donâ€™t want White people envisioning a suspicious Black wearing a hoodie in a gated community staring at their homes? 
The 911 call continues:
â€œâ€˜These aâ€“holes Always get away,â€™ he says to the operator. Zimmerman is then heard giving directions to the dispatcher.â€&#157;
â€œâ€™Sh-t, heâ€™s running,â€™ Zimmerman says.â€&#157;
â€œâ€˜Are you following him?â€™ the dispatchers asked. â€˜Yes,â€™ Zimmerman responds.â€&#157;
â€œâ€˜We donâ€™t need you to do that,â€™ the dispatcher says.â€&#157;
Most liberal media news sites also leave out the 911 portion of the call where Trayvon starts running. At some point Zimmerman got out of his car and Trayvon attacked him. 
Trayvon was a 17 year old football player while Zimmerman was considerably overweight. If a fight broke out, it was because Trayvon chased down Zimmerman, not vice versa. 
During the scuffle, Zimmerman called out for help, but no one responded. Zimmerman suffered a bloody nose and a blow to the back of his head. It was at this point, that Zimmerman -in fear for his life- pulled out his 9mm pistol and shot Trayvon.
The police talked with Zimmerman and observed that he had suffered injuries and was covered with grass after being knocked to the ground. 
At some point the liberal got hold of the story and instead of Trayvon casing houses in the rain, it turned into Trayvon innocently going out for skittles. The liberals donâ€™t have an excuse for why Trayvon ran from and then physically assaulted a Neighborhood Watch volunteer. I guess in the minds of the liberals itâ€™s OK for young Blacks to violently batter White people in our own neighborhoods, and weâ€™re not supposed to respond.

Thankfully Florida has a Concealed Carry law and a â€œstand your groundâ€&#157; law so White people can legally defend themselves from a violent assault. As much as the liberals want to lynch George Zimmerman, they donâ€™t have a legal leg to stand on considering that Trayvon assaulted Zimmerman</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ymgbk</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmi</id></website><link>http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2012/03/21/1157816/protesta-en-miami-por-muerte-de.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T02:28:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T00:22:14+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miyru8</id><link>http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2012/03/21/1157816/protesta-en-miami-por-muerte-de.html#comment-474086702</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/csujs</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
