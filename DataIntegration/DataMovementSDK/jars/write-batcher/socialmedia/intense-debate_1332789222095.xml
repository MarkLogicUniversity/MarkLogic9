                              &lt;b&gt;Return of the Compubots&lt;/b&gt;

This weekâ€™s Inspector Spacetime episode represents a return to form in many ways for the series, as the Inspector and Constable Reggie find themselves faced with an old foe; the relentless, inhuman Compubots. This race of humanoid robots have been a regular foe of the Inspector since the early days of the show, and some fans might argue that they have been rather overused in the most recent seasons of the show. However, I find that the Compubots are used so often because they remain effective, compelling villains. Unlike the Blorgons, there is nothing personal in the actions of the Compubots; they are not living organisms with emotions, with hate and anger, but rather Cold, unfeeling machines. This makes their attack on the peaceful world of Centauri 7 all the more horrifying, for they cannot be reasoned with, bought , or provoked into making a mistake; the Inspector cannot simply spout  a witty retort and drive his enemies into conceiving the means of their own destruction. 

As the viewer soon learns, there is a greater motivation behind this attack. The Eleventh Inspector has encountered more and more of his old enemies over the past several seasons, and the return of the Compubots suggests that there may well be a greater force at work here; that of the Anti-Inspector. We havenâ€™t seen him since his last â€œdeathâ€&#157; at the hands of the Tenth Inspectorâ€™s companion. There doesnâ€™t seem to be any logical reason for the Compubots to attack Centauri 7, though, as the Centauri population, intelligent squid-like creatures, cannot be used to create more Compubots. In the past, the Compubots have  targeted humanoid populations, particularly that of Earth in various timelines, in order to increase their ranks; an attack on a non-humanoid world by Compubots is virtually unheard of within the Inspector Spacetime canon.  This suggests a greater agenda that the Inspector has not yet discovered, and the only known individual with the power to outmaneuver the Inspector to such a degree is the Anti-Inspector himself. 
 
Unfortunately, the Inspector and Constable Reggie are not left free to ponder the greater implications of the attack, as they are swept up in the brutal storm of conflict on Centauri 7. The Inspectorâ€™s plan to wipe out the Compubots entirely is rather shocking, as he normally prefers less direct methods of intervention in a worldâ€™s affairs; detonating a gravionic pulse device in the upper atmosphere is a move more in line with the sensibilities of the Ninth Inspector, who placed greater priority on the defeat of the enemy for the greater good than the protection of as many individuals as possible at the potential expense of the bigger picture. 

Itâ€™s a shame that the episode leaves Off on such a cliffhanger, with the Inspector and the Compubot Centurion about to engage in a lethal game of space checkers while the Constable hacks the Compubot mainframe; however, if the conclusion is anywhere near the quality of this seasonâ€™s episodes so far, it should be quite a satisfying one. Letâ€™s hope that the Compubots havenâ€™t evolved too much for the Inspector to handle!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ddu6z2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/regional-holiday-music,66270/</link><postedTime>2011-12-09T01:30:33+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-01-03T08:35:31+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/exo03x</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/regional-holiday-music,66270/#comment-399421929</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zrhe7</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-12-09</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
