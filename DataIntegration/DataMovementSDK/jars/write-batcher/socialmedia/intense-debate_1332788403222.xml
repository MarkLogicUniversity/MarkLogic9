But the cowardice is also shared by the people in the US because it is they who have elected once and again the same monsters, and it is they who express their brutality not only through invasions of other countries but also through verbal violence. One only has to read the opinions they Vomit in different blogs and forums related to Iraq and Afghanistan, as if they were the offended party. I cannot help thinking of this poor woman&amp;#039;s children who surely thought they were safe in the wolf&amp;#039;s den. Hey Amerika! For how long will you continue being the butcher of the world, the assassin of morality, the rapist of human decency? I have a child, and God forbid she ever witness such spectacle. But this woman&amp;#039;s children are forever wounded, morally and psychologically, by the perversity of those they thought were their neighbours.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:116044:127351965</id><idPostId>127351965</idPostId><idBlogId>116044</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:116044</id><idBlogId>116044</idBlogId><link>http://original.antiwar.com</link><displayName>Antiwar.com Original Articles</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2012/03/25/on-the-death-of-shaima-alawadi/</link><displayName>On the Death of Shaima Alawadi</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:58:52.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:116044:127351965:325001419</id><link>http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2012/03/25/on-the-death-of-shaima-alawadi/#IDComment325001419</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:58:52.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on On the Death of Shaima Alawadi by Jaime</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link/><idEmailMd5>74b9f3e3d3f0ad7034a2e048c92efbd6</idEmailMd5><displayName>Jaime</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>Jaime commented on &lt;a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2012/03/25/on-the-death-of-shaima-alawadi/"&gt;On the Death of Shaima Alawadi&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
