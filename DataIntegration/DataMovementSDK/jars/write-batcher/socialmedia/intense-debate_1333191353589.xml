Â I think you will heal quickly. Â It's hard for me to comment on whether or not being on your feet all day with your job will be hard over time. Â It will be initially but I tend to think you'll heal quicker than I did. Â I'm lucky as I'm a software engineer who slouches in a chair all day. Â In your position you're forced to move in all different directions so you'll put extra emphasis on those minor muscle groups in the lower back. Â Those will hurt initially but become stronger.

My experience is this. Â Before surgery I had "trained" myself to bend in VERY weird ways that wouldÂ alleviateÂ any pain when doing various things. Â For example, to pick up something Off the ground I used to stretch my right leg out and then bend sideways outside my left knee. Â The humpty dance. Â I never realized I made all these weird motions until post surgery after I've healed. Â I can now bend straight down and pick something up like a normal movement. Â This was very hard at first because those "normal" movements involved muscle groups I was never really using. Â It took me a while to build those back up. Â That healing was normal muscle pain and fatigue. Â NOTÂ unmanageableÂ Nerve pain.

So back to your situation. Â I think if you focus on posture, don't move at a super fast pace, be conscious of your movements... you'll be just find in your career.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/geenj7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/m4ub</id></website><link>http://insanum.com/blog/spinal-fusion.html</link><postedTime>2011-05-24T18:30:53+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:32:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwhe15</id><link>http://insanum.com/blog/spinal-fusion.html#comment-480985348</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/afhbf</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-05-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
