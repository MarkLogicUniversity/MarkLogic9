One was making the team and playing a long season. That made him realize that MLB is not college ball or even Minor League ball and the season in the Biggies is long, hard and taxing. Good for him that he addressed that by  season strength training and some weight Gain.That shows character and the will to improve. Also, keep in mind that he became a father for the first time in the second half ofÂ  the season and that alone has a effect on anyone especially mentally.( Do you remember? ) Let's hope he continues his fine performance throughout the year. This guy is a winner...:-)</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zfrml</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27739098%26vkey=news_chc%26c_id=chc</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:32:28+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:51:47+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3kok3</id><link>http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27739098%26vkey=news_chc%26c_id=chc#comment-480174333</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/58u6n</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
