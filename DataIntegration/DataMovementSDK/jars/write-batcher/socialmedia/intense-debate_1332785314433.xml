And as a former "fat kid," and one that has dealt with her weight issues on and  since childhood. My most recent Weight loss was 90lbs. I think that this mother approached the situation very well. Yes the publicÂ humiliationÂ was a bit much, but hopefully it Â helpedÂ the other mothers realize that they shouldn't be feeding that food at all. I wish my mother had pushed me harder at that age to keep my weight in check, but she  gave in to the fact that "ohh I was just a kid". Maybe if she had pushed a little harder, I wouldn't have gotten up to 230 after college, and had re-learn how to eat properly. I have recently joined the fight against childhood obesity, and maybe this mother's methods were Off but hell we are allÂ talkingÂ about it. Maybe it will bring this horrible epidemic to the forefront.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/666dw1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/av50</id></website><link>http://www.refinery29.com/mom-7-year-old-diet</link><postedTime>2012-03-23T16:21:09+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:07:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk92o4</id><link>http://www.refinery29.com/mom-7-year-old-diet#comment-476545410</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-23</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
