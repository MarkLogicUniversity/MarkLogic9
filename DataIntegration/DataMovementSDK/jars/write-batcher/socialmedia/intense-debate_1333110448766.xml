years ago. She was able to tell the PBS reporter the story because she wasn’t home in Florida when 
the bomb went Off.It was on Christmas in 1951, shortly 
after 10 p.m., that someone, likely a Klansman, lighted the fuse to a massive 
explosive charge rigged under the family’s home in Mims, about 40 miles from 
Orlando.Evangeline, then 21 and working in the District as a clerk 
typist for the federal government, learned the tragic details when she arrived 
in Florida two days after Christmas, expecting a joyous family 
reunion.Her father had been killed by the blast that leveled their home; 
her mother, Harriette V. Moore, would die nine days later.  
 
Nobody was ever arrested or charged.  
 
Over 60 years later, a teenager was murdered in Cold blood by a known suspect.  He has not been charged. 
 
We will not forget Harry and Harriette Moore.
 
We will not forget Trayvon Martin.
 
May God bless their souls and bring the truth to light.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z6wfm</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6tdd</id></website><link>http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0329/New-police-video-casts-doubt-on-George-Zimmerman-injuries</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T12:24:54+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:30:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3onga</id><link>http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0329/New-police-video-casts-doubt-on-George-Zimmerman-injuries#comment-480023029</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zz7j8</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
