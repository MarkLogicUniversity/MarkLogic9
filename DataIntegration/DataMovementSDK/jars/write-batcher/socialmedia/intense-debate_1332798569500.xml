I was run over by a dump truck. I spent 2 years on HEAVY doses of OxyContin. I had a kyphoplasty - barely made a difference. I was at wit's end. As an Operating Room Nurse, I obviously couldn't go back to work impaired on Opioid medication. One thing you learn in the OR is that you NEVER want to have surgery. Because of this, I've had way more procedures than I should have ever had to endure.
I got the Dorsal Column Stimulator implant. I wish the final implant would be as effective as the trial was.
It was only the combination of the implant and daily Yoga sessions (sometimes up to 4 sessions per day) that I was finally able to get Off of OxyContin. Fortunately, I don't have that addition gene to cope with. But I will tell you this - If I miss just one day of Yoga, I feel it, and it's not good. I am way too young for this (37).</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/561w95</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/8z2j</id></website><link>http://cms.lifescript.com/?sc_itemid=%7b0AF712BE-D229-4D3B-A198-04A735CF9E54%7d&amp;sc_mode=preview&amp;sc_lang=en</link><postedTime>2011-03-21T23:13:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:47:39+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkosme</id><link>http://cms.lifescript.com/?sc_itemid=%7b0AF712BE-D229-4D3B-A198-04A735CF9E54%7d&amp;sc_mode=preview&amp;sc_lang=en#comment-476679426</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
