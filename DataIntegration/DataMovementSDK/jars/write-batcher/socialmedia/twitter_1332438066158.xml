While the Daily's "Smoking ads grim but true" editorial rightly heaps praise upon the CDC's new hard-hitting "Tips from Former 
Smokers" campaign, the end of each ad is a quitter referral pipeline to failure.

In June 2000, the CDC allowed pharmaceutical influence to write 
official U.S. quitting policy.  Since then, unless contraindicated, approved quitting products should be used by "ALL" smokers 
attempting to quit.  The policy instantly killed support and backing for all other quitting methods, while instantly transforming all federal and state health care employees into pharm industry salesmen.



Each year more smokers stop smoking Cold turkey than by all other 
methods combined (Chapman 2011). While approved quitting products clobber 
placebo inside clinical trials, Cold turkey clobbers them just as badly in 
real-world quitting (Doran 2006).  The CDC's campaign sends quitters to 
either SmokeFree.gov with it's 173 suggestions to use medication, or 
to 1-800-QUIT-NOW where the counseling script objective is nicotine patch, gum, 
lozenge, spray, inhaler, bupropion or varenicline use.


The CDC openly admits that the medication  - with its false "double your chances" promise - has stalled 
quitting.  Recent real-world studies have found that replacement nicotine undercuts successful quitting have called for re-examination of our "meds only" policy (Alpert 2012 and Pierce 
2012).  Sadly, the CDC refuses to examine current policy while continuing to 
falsely teach smokers that their Natural instincts are all wrong, that Cold 
turkey quitting is extremely difficult and few succeed.  While the CDC's 
campaign guarantees big pharm big profits, at what price in terms of 
needless failed attempts, highly frustrated quitting, and lives ultimately lost?John R.
