50 murders that will committed this month alone by black people?  
Hypocrisy.



Act like thugs. Accidents may happen or aggravated murder who knows. Zimmerman may be guilty of putting himself in a bad Spot. He may be guilty of murder. While trying to protect a community though. 





Who knows. It sure beats all of the murders committed this week that weren't by accident or bad conclusions performed mostly by which group? Gee I wonder.



You won't see Al Sharpton showing up to any black on black or white assaults or murders this week I guarantee that though. Hypocrisy at its best.
