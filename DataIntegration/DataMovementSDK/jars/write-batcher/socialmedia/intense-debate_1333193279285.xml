  Get rid of that ghetto mentality that you are a victim of the man. Pick yourself up and  like a man or woman who is proud to be you, and get Off the Cry-baby train.
  Trayvon was out with burglary tools and womens jewelry in his back-pack so he wasn't coming back from church or visiting a sick friend. He shouldn't have been out at 2 or 3 in the morning, period.
  His post was that he was a "made gangsta" which usually means he has killed someone to prove his place in a gang. His bad choices cost him his life. When the facts come to light, he was a burglar that paid the ultimate price for his crimes.
  Zimmerman should not have been in the position to shoot this guy and the courts will straighten that out without all the rioting and revenge that is now being planned.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hkomp</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/jpbk</id></website><link>http://theweek.com/article/index/226172/why-is-trayvon-martins-mother-trademarking-his-name</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T22:10:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:39:48+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwhls6</id><link>http://theweek.com/article/index/226172/why-is-trayvon-martins-mother-trademarking-his-name#comment-480993418</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
