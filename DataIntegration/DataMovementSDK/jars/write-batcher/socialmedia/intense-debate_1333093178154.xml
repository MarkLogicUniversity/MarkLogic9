That reality alone is enough to surely indicate that calories in/calories out doesn't apply to everyone.
Essentially, and many studies (dating back before the Sixties) have indicated that weight Gain is largely genetic. Where a person accumulates fat deposits is determined by their genes. Perhaps a similar phenomenon can be researched by endocrinologists regarding metabolism.
The problem with the idea of environmental contaminants is that it presents an impossible task. Impossible because you can't differentiate and find a causal link when there are so many chemical additives in food, containers and in our environment.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/y0ehlr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/eyjq</id></website><link>http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/whats-really-making-us-fat/254087/</link><postedTime>2012-03-08T13:12:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-08T22:34:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mxw5uc</id><link>http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/whats-really-making-us-fat/254087/#comment-460127487</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hbvod</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-08</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
