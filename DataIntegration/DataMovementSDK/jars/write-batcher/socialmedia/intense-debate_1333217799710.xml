I've dealt with this for 10+ years and have  felt it inevitable to sacrifice either visibility or authenticity just to live in the world. I hate that I have to come out to every person I meet. 

I even sometimes try to "dress gayer" when I go places where there are likely to be a lot of lesbians, which makes me feel like an idiot teenager again, making myself uncomfortable trying to be something I'm not. I Always had this vision of just bursting onto the gay scene and instantly being a valued part of some tight-knit community. But more often than not I've found that sexual orientation is barely enough to sustain a conversation, let alone a friendship/ relationship. 

It's so dumb that it's 2012 and I feel like I need a strategically colored/ placed bandanna or earring or whatever to broadcast my preferences.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67h2i4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gsdf</id></website><link>http://thoughtcatalog.com/2012/why-lipstick-lesbians-have-to-keep-on-coming-out-of-the-closet/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:16:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:51:33+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwtt2y</id><link>http://thoughtcatalog.com/2012/why-lipstick-lesbians-have-to-keep-on-coming-out-of-the-closet/#comment-481185369</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cw74q</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
