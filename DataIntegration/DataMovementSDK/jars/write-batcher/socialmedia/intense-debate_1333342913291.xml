That part reflects a certain logic, albeit a Chamber-of-Commerce kind of selfish logic, as seen in the willingness to let mines collapse and rivers become fouled while writing Off their trashing of the common good as a necessary part of doing business. But in our current political climate, that's not good enough for the GOP hatemongers. They have to amp up the "welfare queen" narrative to a Fever pitch, in the process demonstrating  their true lack of human empathy or capacity for adult thinking. Evidenced by the way they seem so tickled about the cleverness of their imagery.  So apparently (to respond to Sophia B) hating doesn't take anything out of them, it only seems to energize them, like schoolyard bullies.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h9zo8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ydw9</id></website><link>http://motherjones.com/node/169431</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T18:13:21+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:48:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m346rf</id><link>http://motherjones.com/node/169431#comment-479543749</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/m22tb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
