ICE and our current Federal Government are the most Cowardly, Pathetic group of people on the planet. What in the heck is the point of having a law if you won't hold criminals accountable. Reminds me of New York at the turn of the 20th century, Tammany Hall in the 1900'sÂ New York. The corruption in the federalÂ government is unprecedented. If any American citizen pulled this stunt they would be punished far more harshly. If an American citizen were in Mexico and stated that they were in the country illegally they would end up inÂ aÂ Mexican jail faster than you can say Holy Frijoles. What a distusting display of the Spineless Cowards running the country. Makes me want to Vomit.Â Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yyqxi</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yhpi</id></website><link>http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/immigration/undocumented-protesters-after-arrest-no-regrets-3-21-2012</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T04:32:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:23:16+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi84kx</id><link>http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/immigration/undocumented-protesters-after-arrest-no-regrets-3-21-2012#comment-473769489</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gvxxe</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
