Ahh, but Obama has a record now. 

Â RepublicansÂ did publicly warn Obama not to try and pass such bitterlyÂ divisive legislation--like this onerous boondoggle known as Obamacare--with suchÂ slender partisanÂ majorities. It just wasn't ever going toÂ pass the smell test with the American People.Â Much lessÂ the laugh test of the Congressional Budget Office--based on its screwyÂ funding gimmicks. And hey, politics is  the art of compromise--in a nation as culturally and politically diverse--as America.

Obama paid no heed to them. He contemptuously told RepublicansÂ to sit in the back of the car and shutup. Then he proceeded to cram this constitutionally suspect bill straight down our throats. 

I must strongly disagree with you. Nothing in Obama's pompous and chuckleheaded demeanor suggests he's scary. He's just plainÂ stupid. And too thick-headed to ever take anyone's counsel but his own.Â  But he was duly warned--by the Republicans--thatÂ a bipartisan approach is Always best...And Obama and the Democrats publicly told them--and all America--to go screw. Now, Burn baby, Burn.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zi8ry</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/71fv</id></website><link>http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-30/obama-campus-fervor-losing-to-apathy-as-students-sour-on-2012.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:21:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:29:01+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwsejs</id><link>http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-30/obama-campus-fervor-losing-to-apathy-as-students-sour-on-2012.html#comment-481871948</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/az6hu</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
