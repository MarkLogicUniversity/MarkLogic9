I must admit I am totally addicted to watching Pixiwoos makeup tutorials on You Tube and of corse your good friend Tanya Burr. This is how I got to hear about this product. Sam Chapman from Pixiwoo raves about this and her skin  looks amazing so I would love to try it. She Always comments that she has very Dry skin and so do I so if this works for her then I hope it would do the same for me.
My favourite skin care product at the moment is the Embryolisse Lait-Creme Concentre (also another Pixiwoo fav) it really hydrates and smooths Dry skin!
Lots of love Becca King xxxx</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l94h3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4ib9</id></website><link>http://www.fleurdeforce.com/articles/158/</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T16:46:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:28:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3t0ck</id><link>http://www.fleurdeforce.com/articles/158/#comment-479529211</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zz575</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
