I live in a share house sort of arrangement where it is sometimes up to 8 people to one toilet. It is awful beyond words. When I first moved in I genuinly developed an Anxiety about going to the bathroom because there were so many people and someone would  knock. I actually preffered public toilets it was so bad. The worst thing though, some of the people living here don't Always close the door when they are pooping. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE HORROR? And it's not the men either, it's the WOMEN. So now I have not only an Anxiety about going to the bathroom, going anywhere near the bathroom is even scarier.
