BARADWAJ RANGAN

Ninety-nine years ago, Dadasaheb Phalke made a movie about a king who never lied. The king couldn't have lied even if he wanted to. The film was silent. But today, with so many films being made in so many languages, what will we be celebrating, really, when we raise a toast to a century of our cinema?

Excerpts

Like the nation of India, the notion of Indian cinema is simultaneously specific and frustratingly vague. What is Indian cinema? Cinema that is made in India, certainly. But what else? Is it the cinema that spins stories about India and Indians? In that case, would â€œGandhiâ€&#157;, the story of the most famous Indian of them all, qualify as Indian cinema, even if its makers are from outside India? Or is Indian cinema identified by narration in a particular style, a recognisably Indian style, hearts on sleeves, songs and dances? By that definition, Thiagarajan Kumararaja's â€œAaranya Kaandamâ€&#157; may not quite be Indian cinema. Though made in Tamil and mounted against Heated Tamils, it speaks a clinical language of film from cooler climes. Does Indian cinema denote the films made after the country was freed from her fetters? In that case, â€œRaja Harischandraâ€&#157;, whose centenary has sparked these celebrations, isn't really an Indian film because it was made in a British colony. We should have to wait for Independence to begin talking about Indian cinema.

We might even celebrate the gradual encroachment of Indian cinema not just into New York but also onto the august pages of the New York Times, where Indian films are now reviewed like films in other foreign languages. But the tone of these reviews is a slap of Cold wind, a blustering reality check that our films are treated, mostly, with arch amusement and a benign tolerance for a crazy people who sing and dance and just cannot be taken seriously.

----------

Almost all our films from the pre-digital  are damaged in some form, and even if we don't have â€” as  does â€” a system of enshrining classics in National Film Registries, we might at least  that acceptable prints are available to future generations.

"a benign tolerance for a crazy people who sing and dance"

The grammar of our films include songs and dances. So be it. The result what a fantastic repertoire of music/songs we have been blessed with.  In Hindi language films, we have had a golden age of music (IMO from 1949 to 1977 - take or leave a year or two) . Again, IMO, 1958, 1959 and 1960 were the peak years of this age. 

Some of the artisans (in no particular order) who have made it possible - Shankar Jaikishan, S D Burman, Madan Mohan, C Ramchandra, Naushad Ali, Khayyam, Kalyanji Anandji, Mohammad Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Mukesh, Asha Bhosle, Geeta Dutt, Talat Mehmood, Hemant Kumar, Manna Dey, Kishore Kumar, Shailendra, Hasrat Jaipuri, Rajinder Krishan, Sahir Ludhianvi, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Qamar Jalalabadi, Shakeel Badayuni - the list is too long to include everybody. I salute these souls to giving us so much Joy.

It would be true of films in other languages too.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r35fp</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xtge</id></website><link>http://blogs.hindustantimes.com/separated-at-birth/2012/03/26/anna%e2%80%99s-anti-congress-encore/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:02:40+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T17:32:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw0t8c</id><link>http://blogs.hindustantimes.com/separated-at-birth/2012/03/26/anna%e2%80%99s-anti-congress-encore/#comment-482025243</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gg7vk</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
