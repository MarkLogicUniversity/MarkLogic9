Pregnancy prevention doesn't Always work.
2. Those who are most likely to find themselves in a situation dire enough to have to consider abortion likely didn't have access to or didn't realize they'd need it, like the 14 year-old girl I knew who became pregnant as a result of being raped by her faster parent. 
3. If you're such an extreme advocate of birth control access, how about getting to your local representative instead of trolling open forums insulting women and making generalizations you know nothing about? 

Also, I think it's worth noting that this clip is about why it's important to keep abortion legal. I can see you have no appreciation for women, but as you're so staunchly "pro-life" perhaps you can find it within your ideals to appreciate that a woman who Bleeds to death is the loss of a life as well. Really, though, why don't you people ever think of the mothers' lives? Why don't you people ever think of the life of the fetus after birth? Who do you think you are?Â  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zq68k</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zmtw</id></website><link>http://front.moveon.org/youll-never-believe-what-women-went-through-before-roe-vs-wade/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:43:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:40:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwk7pg</id><link>http://front.moveon.org/youll-never-believe-what-women-went-through-before-roe-vs-wade/#comment-481837001</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lm8dh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
