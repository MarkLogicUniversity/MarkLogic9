If anything the only time blacks are Spot-lighted it's to report something negative.But certainly blacks have to deal with strugglesÂ in their lives that whites will never have to deal with.Whites don't have to worry about being pulled over by some racist whiteÂ cop just because of the color of theirÂ skin.When whites go into a store,they don't have to worry about being watched or followed by clerks because the clerks are too busy watching the black person that just walked in.When a white person goes missing,there is no begging and pleading for authorities to get involved.A search party is immediately assembled.This is unheard of when the person is black. In fact, blacks are lucky if their missing loved one is even mentioned on the 6Â  o'clock news.Â I could go on and on but I think you get the picture.It's funny to me how after all the privileges and advantages whites have over blacks,some still complain even when the slightest tilt of the scales happen in the other direction.A young innocent boy has been murdered you idiots.If this were your son,you would want swift justice too!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yrsqd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/22/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T06:52:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T01:05:33+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miypqt</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/22/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-474109901</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hie26</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
