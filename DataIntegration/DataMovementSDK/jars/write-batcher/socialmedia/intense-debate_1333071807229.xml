I went natural almost a year ago b/c I was tired of unhealthy hair and spending money on perms. I didn't even know what "natural" was honestly until my friend suggested it to me after venting about not know what to do with my hair. Â 
While I love running into other naturals and exchanging tips and things, I've never thought myself as "special" or anything compared to women to chemically straighten their hair. It's not a big deal. Yes I do feel that there is a problem with the fact that many Black women will tell me that my hair is cute but it's not professional and only certain women can "pull it ". It's the way our hair grows out of our heads...we all can "pull it ". On the flip side I hate the naturals who approach me like we're apart of some Secret club of enlightened women and we should "convert" all the others. I don't care what everyone else is doing with their hair.Â Ps: Michelle Obama and her daughters are natural. No perm; she straightens her hair via Heat. Not trying to be a pain I just wanted to point that out.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zruxq</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/uf8t</id></website><link>http://madamenoire.com/151411/yes-my-hair-is-relaxed-so-what/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:01:30+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:13:07+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3x3r5</id><link>http://madamenoire.com/151411/yes-my-hair-is-relaxed-so-what/#comment-479713504</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
