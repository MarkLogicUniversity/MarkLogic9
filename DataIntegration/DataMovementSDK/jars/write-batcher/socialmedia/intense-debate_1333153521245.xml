It was Heejun's time to go, no question about it and I thought that DeAndre deserved to be in the bottom 3 rather than Skylar (and I don't like country).  Heejun's antics finally caught up to him and when he was serious, it was pretty clear that his singing was lacking (still very good for someone who allegedly only started singing a few months ago).
