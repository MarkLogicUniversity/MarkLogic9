I satirize to make a point.  Though the good folks behind the word Ban are trying to do something worthy it is probably best to let people use their God given brains to distinguish proper use of words.

PS - By the way, many religions have already taken the name Jehovah out of their Bible's.  They did that to placate religious leaders who did not like the name.
