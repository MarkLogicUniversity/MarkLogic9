1)Â  Anthropogenic pollution in the form of black soot and carbon dioxide has caused and contributed to Arctic warming, and

2)Â  This warming has fundamentally altered the Earth's Heat pump.

There, that wasn't so bad was it?Â  Nothing particularly freaky about it, when you take into consideration the ocean oscillation currents in the Pacific (ENSO) and Atlantic (NAO).Â  In fact, there is no "freaky weather" anywhere in climate science unless it is an extreme event like the magnetosphere flipping poles, giant meteors, huge volcanoes, and other cataclysmic events that go boom and the entire world is affected at once.Â  

Nope, climate change is a very slow "rising Tide" of slightly changing weather patterns that are averaged into monthly, yearly, 30-year "climo," and longer scales of time that includes historical meteorology and paleoclimatology.Â  We see the subtle changes in the polar jets, the progression of high and low pressure cells, and other things that can be explained in a calm, cool, detached manner.Â  

Thus the "chicken little" and "freaky weather" approached are in my opinion rather self-defeating.Â  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zq5ar</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/thxi</id></website><link>http://grist.org/climate-change/climate-change-is-already-harshing-the-weather/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:36:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:32:02+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwrk6d</id><link>http://grist.org/climate-change/climate-change-is-already-harshing-the-weather/#comment-480923936</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/yfn2x</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
