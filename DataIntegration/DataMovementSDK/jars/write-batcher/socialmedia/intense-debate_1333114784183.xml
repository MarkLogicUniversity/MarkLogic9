Â 
i bet u take solace from the fact that ure not the only kind on this planet who are black and ugly as sh1t, and there are few (sri lanka) immigrants in india who resemble ur color. u can thank ltte for that.Â 
imagine a tiny island called sri lanka and their toygers got submerged in the indian ocean. im sure sangakkara, will be swimming his way to india looking for asylum after his Aussie masters ignore his sos.
if a sri lanka toyger fan claims india is a 3rd world country, then what world would sri lanka be in. 7th world atleast. again reminding sri lanka toygers not to take things literally and work their tiny brains over-time and start counting all seven.

sri lanka is a tiny island, they no longer are refugees under ltte. yet they havent gone on to develop their country. instead they are even worse with a bankrupt board.
on the other hand, india, being a democracy, where everyone's opinions are taken into account before making any decisions, and still we're far far ahead of wastelands like sri lanka in every single aspect of life and society. i bet this sri lanka toyger fan, hums some bollywood love song after finally getting his first kiss that too from his gay bf. imagine what all indian he'd do after making out with his gay bf.  Â 

do all sri lanka toygers fail to spell 'v' and end up sounding 'w'. like abesinghe who thinks its 'wital' to mention the word 'vital' while commentating and take pride at being the laughing stock of everyone. just curious.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z5nfk</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/y62v</id></website><link>http://www.espnstar.com/cricket/international-cricket/news/detail/item777763/Trott-keeps-England%27s-run-chase-alive/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T07:14:37+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:38:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3xy0p</id><link>http://www.espnstar.com/cricket/international-cricket/news/detail/item777763/Trott-keeps-England%27s-run-chase-alive/#comment-479683289</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/eok1v</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
