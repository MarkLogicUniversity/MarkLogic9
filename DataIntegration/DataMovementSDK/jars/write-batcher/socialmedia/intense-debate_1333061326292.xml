But you're correct, teams usually go with two infielders, don't they?Â 

Mitch definitely won't be named later ... they're going to send Houston another minor leaguer. That's what was said at the time of the trade. Kouz has a minor-league contract, with an option to be released if not brought up to the majors by May 1st. So they have every incentive to leave him in AAA and see how things go during April.

ps. in regard to the Houston trade, it seems like we had the best of the deal with a backup catcher + a backup OF for two A level pitchers, doesn't it? But bear in mind that there was probably no-one else who wanted Quintero at the time, not even Houston since they had three catchers competing for the 2 Spots. Plus Mr. B., although looking excellent so far, was regarded as chump change generally speaking.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z88xt</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120328%26content_id=27713380%26vkey=news_kc%26c_id=kc</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T04:40:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:51:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3q74q</id><link>http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120328%26content_id=27713380%26vkey=news_kc%26c_id=kc#comment-479597131</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cs7cw</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
