As unethical and vicious the tactics of Battle were, they were at the behest of a board that called on their type of guy to do exactly that.  Are the investigative reporters afraid of the multimillionarie Penthouse magazine owner and his ilk?  The board is made up of dollar-driven power mongers who live by situational ethics.  Do you really think they thought Battle was an inspirational, squeaky clean, servant leader?  Come on -- they knew exactly what they had gotten, and they ran for the hills when it crashed down on them.  It's way easier to knife the scapegoat than to sell the slash-and-Burn tactics to the constituency.  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/g03ky7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/r2x9</id></website><link>http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2011-07-21/news/losing-battle-fort-lauderdale-s-most-elite-school-pine-crest-reels-from-99-days-of-ill-fated-leadership/</link><postedTime>2011-07-19T18:49:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-08-13T18:00:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/5f0qm2</id><link>http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2011-07-21/news/losing-battle-fort-lauderdale-s-most-elite-school-pine-crest-reels-from-99-days-of-ill-fated-leadership/#comment-285512940</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-07-19</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
