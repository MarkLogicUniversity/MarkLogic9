	BEIRUT: One wounded Syrian man died Friday soon after crossing into the
 east Lebanon town of Joura in the Bekaa as the Syrian army tightened 
security measures along the border.

	The security measures by the Syrian army appear to be aimed at halting Syrian fleeing the unrest in their home country.

	Heavy fire could be heard coming from the Syrian villages of Jousieh and al-Quseir.

	Meanwhile, the Lebanese Army maintained its security measures and patrols along the border.

	Lebanonâ€™s eastern border has been under the spotlight following several
 failed arms smuggling operations and the arrest of a number of people 
trading arms and smuggling weapons into Syria.

	On Wednesday, the Lebanese Army seized two truckloads of weapons in 
Joura, the latest in a series of  that have caused panic in the 
area.

	A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Daily 
Star that the weapons were concealed in two Cold-storage trucks parked 
on a back road in Masharih al-Qaa.

	Earlier this week, the army arrested 10 armed Lebanese and Syrian men 
in Joura. They were driving vehicles loaded with weapons including 
mortar shells, rocket-Propelled grenades and military uniforms. Those 
arrested were interrogated by army intelligence in Ablah in the Bekaa 
and the security source said they were referred to the Armyâ€™s Beirut 
headquarters Thursday.

	The Syrian leadership blames â€œarmed gangsâ€&#157; for the violence in the 
country. The U.N. estimates over 8,000 Syrians, mostly civilians, have 
been killed since a government crackdown against protesters was launched
 in March 2011.

	Lebanon has vowed to boost measures along the border to prevent arms smuggling into its neighbor.
