I certainly sympathize with the parents who listen to their child Wheeze and Cough while waiting for the antibiotics to heal their child. I also empathize with the parent who, after a series of vaccinations, [most of which have absolutely no guarantee of immunity from the disease in which they are intended, and some of which will actually shed the disease] have to struggle with why their 12 month oldÂ  is screaming totally unaware that the child's brain is swelling causing irreversible brain damage or even death. You call the doctor and they say, "Oh don't worry that's a normal reaction to the vaccines, just give him a dose of Tylenol, he will be okay." Meanwhile .... Tic...tock....Tic ....tock...

So yeah, let's have a bunch of brown shirted goose stepping police enforce a government mandated vaccine program.... as long as you personally take full responsibility for all the adverse reactions. Put your money where your mouth is.  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/yfjoni</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmo</id></website><link>http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/02/24/1879059/vaccinations-should-be-covered.html</link><postedTime>2012-02-24T08:03:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-02-25T02:21:47+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mzwzmu</id><link>http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/02/24/1879059/vaccinations-should-be-covered.html#comment-448382579</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5y1kp</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-02-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
