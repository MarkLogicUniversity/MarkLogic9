Maybe I'm having an Anxiety attack ... so I feel threatened. Or maybe he's wearing a shirt I think looks "Off" or has a message on it I don't agree with. Maybe he's wearing a NRA tee and I just assume he's violent or "carrying" and so that makes me feel threatened. 

Do I have the right to shoot (and kill) your kid under any of those circumstances? 

If I don't have the right to shoot your kid just because I'm the nervous type, then the right to bear - and shoot - is not unlimited. That's where gun control comes in.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h7dl1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/28/bill-maher-blames-the-democrats-for-the-trayvon-martin-shooting/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T14:41:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:24:59+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwrfjf</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/28/bill-maher-blames-the-democrats-for-the-trayvon-martin-shooting/#comment-480916789</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/u438</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
