The initial fear-mongering of "Global Warming!" was turned on its head as Europe and America suffered some of the most brutal winters in recent history while, more importantly, the "scientific data" was revealed to be a coordinated hoax. What to do? Just rename the terminology "Climate Change!", which conveniently encompasses BOTH warm and Cold temperatures experienced throughout the globe. Surely, that should've cemented the propaganda but as Delingpole correctly implies, the particular terminology conjured up by leftists was not rabid enough to instill the requisite amount of AGW panic and alarm into the population when they experienced (normal) weather patterns like Heat waves, droughts and storms. So now we've got Global Weirding! As stated, the left must  move the goal posts when trying to achieve their "utopian" agenda because for them, the ends ALWAYS justifies the means. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67jj28</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ms5i</id></website><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100148381/global-weirding-the-new-big-lie/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T11:15:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:33:33+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwklhh</id><link>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100148381/global-weirding-the-new-big-lie/#comment-481832545</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6cz2v</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
