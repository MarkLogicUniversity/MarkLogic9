You are right that  now has 72 PGA Â victories, but Rory only has 3, NOT 6.

Rory has 6 worldwide victories, so if you want to compare world wide wins between Rory and , it is not 72 vs 6, I do not have the exact number, but I believe its around 100 or more if you include World wide wins.

Comparing  to Rory in PGA wins is 72-3

Rory hype is simply manufactured by the media, he will never come anywhere near what they are planning for him.

I see Rory not even Reaching anywhere near Phil`s status when his career is said and done.

Probably be along the lines of Els/Furic, nothing to Sneeze atÂ </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rnzjr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/9dd2</id></website><link>http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golftalkcentral/woods-knew-win-was-coming/</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T23:51:40+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:09:52+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mku68m</id><link>http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golftalkcentral/woods-knew-win-was-coming/#comment-476417455</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/eurzb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
