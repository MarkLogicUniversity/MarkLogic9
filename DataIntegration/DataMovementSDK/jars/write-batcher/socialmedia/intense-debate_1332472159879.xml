The Nazi movement which did
horrifying atrocities to the people was based on racial superiority.
Adolf Hitler who was the main architect of the Nazi organization was
supported by many intellectuals. Many leaders of the National Socialist
German Workerâ€™s Party (Nazi) had many things in common. They all
believed in destructive Nazi nightmare of racial hearted and ethnic
cleansing. What was the psychology behind such a fascist movement which
violated basic human rights? Were they psychologically deviated?

Psychologist Gustave Gilbert analyzed many Nazi leaders like Herman
Goering, Albert Speer, von Ribbentrop Rudolf Hob (the commandant of
Auschwitz concentration camp) etc during the Nuremberg trials and
revealed the inner nature of the Nazis. He found that Nazis lacked
empathy. In their personal lives they were good husbands and fathers.
They loved their children. But when the dark side of their nature came
in to action they could kill tens of thousands of men, women and
children in the gas chambers. After committing these crimes their
conscience were not shattered. They had no guilty feelings.

Nazi leaders conspired to wage war committed crimes against humanity
and felt that they are doing it for the betterment of the German people.
They saw other races especially Jews as sub humans. There are many
theories beneath Hitlerâ€™s antisemitism. Some Germans believed that they
lost the WW1 as a result of the betrayal by the Jewish businessmen who
did not support the war efforts. But the truth was there were many
Jewish officers who fought for Germany during the Great War. Hitler had
personal experience which led to deep mistrust and hatred against Jews.

Hitlerâ€™s mother was suffering from a breast cancer and she was dying.
When her Jewish doctor broke the bad news to young Hitler he thought
that the physician was responsible for her death. Hence hefty anger and
prejudice was building inside his mind from young days. He was capable
of generalizing this anger and prejudice against the Jewish people. When
he came to power Hitlerâ€™s leadership caused the Holocaust or the
genocide of approximately six million European Jews during the WW2.

Nazis committed atrocities in the occupied territories. In the
Eastern Europe especially in the USSR they unleashed horrible
aggression. Women were raped in front of their husbands and children,
men were killed in masses, and some were driven to forced labor. In all
these events their lack of empathy and lack of remorse were pronounced
greatly. According to Gustave Gilbert Nazis leaders had a dual nature.
Above all they believed that they were doing the right thing.

Based on the interviews of the Nazi leaders Gustave Gilbert published
a book called Nuremberg Diary in 1947. These documents disclose the
psyche of the Nazi leaders. When the Nazi leader Herman Goering was
interviewed by Gustav Gilbert, Goering said: â€œOf course the people donâ€™t
want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a
war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in
one piece. . . . But after all it is the leaders of the country that
determine the policy and it is  a simple matter to drag the people
along.â€&#157;

People can  be brought to the will of the leaders. That is
easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and
denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country
to danger. It works the same way in any country.â€&#157;

Goering was obsessed by Hitlerâ€™s personality. On one occasion Goering
said my conscious is FÃ¼hrerâ€™s (Hitlerâ€™s) conscious. They were ready to
follow Hitler under any circumstances. Therefore many Nazis leaders
shared a common mental structure.

Nazis were able to create a mass hysteria and mass conditioning of
the German people. Millions of people believed in Nazi propaganda and
adored Hitler. No doubt that Hitler was a charismatic leader and an
excellent orator. Gilbert studied the inner nature of Adolf Hitler. In
1950; Gilbert published The Psychology of Dictatorship. In this book,
Gilbert made an attempt to portray a profile of the psychological
behavior of Adolf Hitler.

Why Hitler preached racial superiority? Has he had any doubts about
his origin? Hitlerâ€™s grandmother Anna Maria Schicklgruber became
pregnant while working as a servant in a Jewish household. Hitler made
daring attempts to conceal this factor and had fears that his pure Aryan
blood was contaminated. When he was about to be the absolute leader of
the Germany one newspaper published an article stating that the shape of
Hitlerâ€™s nose is more Hungarian than German. Hitler was furious about
this article and eventually he hunted the journalist who wrote it.
Hitler admired the music of Wagner. Wagner was an anti-Semite.

As a boy Hitler was tormented, humiliated and mocked by his father.
Hitlerâ€™s father punished him for a slightest mistake he made. When he
became an adult leader he ruled the Germany with an iron fist. His aunt
Johanna was a schizophrenic patient and little Hitler was terrified by
his auntâ€™s psychotic behavior. In the later years Hitler ordered to
terminate every psychiatric person in Germany. He could not stand them.

In his speech in 1937 April Hitler said,

All that concerns me is never to take a step that I might later have
to retrace and never to take a step which could damage us in any way.
You must understand that I  go as far as I dare and never further.
It is vital to have a sixth sense which tells you broadly what you can
and cannot do.

Hence Hitler was determined to continue his destructive efforts
despite the protests made by the civilized world. He misinterpreted the
religion and used it to justify his atrocities against Jewish people. In
his autobiography Mein Kampf (P46) Hitler mentions the following
statement.

I believe to-day that my conduct is in accordance with the will of
the Almighty Creator. In standing guard against the Jew I am defending
the handiwork of the Lord.

Henry Murray, a prominent personality specialist at Harvard
University hypothesized that Hitler was deeply confused about his
sexuality. Analyzing the metaphors in his book Mein Kampf, Murray says
that Hitler was unable to come to terms with his complex sexuality.
Henry Murray claimed that Hitler was both impotent and a â€œfully fledged
masochistâ€&#157;. His niece Galee became so tormented by his sexual jealousy
and committed suicide. Hitlerâ€™s sexual inadequacy may have led to
exorbitant cravings for superiority. Lothar Machtan has argued in his
book The Hidden Hitler that Hitler was homosexual. 

Although Hitler proclaimed that the Third Reich was invincible and
would last for thousands of years the system was collapsing in front of
his eyes. In the verge of the defeat his passion for Germany changed
dramatically. Adolf Hitler issued his infamous â€œNero Decree,â€&#157; the order
to destroy all German industry and infrastructure. Hitlerâ€™s Minister of
War Industry Albert Speer sabotaged this auto destructive plan. On 30
April 1945 when the Red Army was advancing Hitler committed suicide with
Eva Braun in the FÃ¼hrerbunker.

Psychology of Nazism demonstrates the savage part of the human
nature. Leaders can tune the people and make them hate and terminate
other ethnic groups without remorse. When the people are being
desensitized they follow the leaders blindly. Influential charismatic
negative leadership can bring total chaos to the Humankind.

Following poem reveals the life time suffering of a victim of the
Auschwitz concentration camp and the magnitude of trauma caused by the
Nazi ideology.

Auschwitz (By Dr Ruwan M Jayatunge )

My heart cried
When my feet touched Auschwitz
Although many years have passed
It seems like yesterday

I was brought here
Along with my family
We traveled three nights in a cattle train
Fully packed and had no space to move

When my little sister asked for water
I gave my water bottle with a small loaf of bread
Then she slept on my lap
But I was awake all the time

When the train stopped
The Doors were opened
There were no welcome signs
The SS men came with guns and dogs
SS-TotenkopfverbÃ¤nde greeted no one

When I saw Sonder- Commanders
I could read their eyes
They moved like living dead
Gave no word or smile

It was winter and I felt Cold
I took a deep breath
My inner mind whispered
You have come to the land of death
When the Commandant came
We were separated
Some went to the labor camp
And the others to the gas chamber

They gazed my parents
Along with my little sister
Their ashes were scattered
All over Auschwitz

Countless nights
I lived with the memory of my family
I worked all day long
But we were under fed

Famine and Cold
Fear and beatings
Humiliations and torture
Every single day
We experienced death

There was no hope
There was no salvation
Only option left was
The electrified fence

After many years
We heard rumors
The War is going to end
And the Red Army is moving towards Berlin

In the final days of the War
The Nazis were frantic
Joshua said
They might terminate us all
On the 27th January 1945
The Red Army came to Auschwitz
Many of us were walking skeletons

They gave us food
And said soon the War will be over
Many became astonished
But my feelings were numbed

On the day of the liberation
Auschwitz survivors were parted
Many went to their homes
But I had no place to go
Because my family was no more
With Joshua I moved to Santa Barbara

Many years after the war
Again I came to Auschwitz
Not as a prisoner this time
But as a witness

This is the place they eliminated my entire family
I recalled my parents and little sister
They went through the gas chimney
Without telling me good bye

I tightly held Joshuaâ€™s hand
When I saw the remnants of the gas chamber
I felt despair
I had no tears to cry

I could hear many voices in this place
Million and half
Men women and children
Who were murdered by the Nazis
Then I clearly heard my little sister saying
Sara thank you for coming to see me

I closed my eyes
I wanted to be alone

Why did they do this to us?
Why Why ?

If I could speak to the whole world

I would say a few words

Please do not let it happen

Never again

Never again
