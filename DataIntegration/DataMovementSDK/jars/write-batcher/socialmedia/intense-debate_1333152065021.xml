If one watch their station only one would be convinced that"poor little George Zimmerman" was just defending himself.  Look at the "interview" with Judge Zimmerman.  The interviewer totally fed the man questions that Professed the innocence of his son.  Interviewer: "Did Trayvon say anything to your son that would have led him to believe that his life was in danger?"  Judge Zimmerman: "Yes.  He said something along the lines of 'You're going to die tonight.'"  He said this with with such certitude that one might believe he was there.  He was not.  Zimmerman should have been arrested and questioned the night of the murder.  People are left to wonder and speculate and, yes, make their own judgements because justice was not served the night Trayvon Martin was gunned down in Cold blood.  Zimmerman said, on tape to the 911 dispatcher, "They Always get away."  It seems as though they do if their fathers are ex-judges and they have ample time to fabricate a "just cause" defense.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zoqzx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tz1k</id></website><link>http://www.mediaite.com/tv/hannity-takes-on-trayvon-martin-attorney-are-we-at-a-point-where-theres-been-a-rush-to-judgment/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:49:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T11:19:19+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwgbd0</id><link>http://www.mediaite.com/tv/hannity-takes-on-trayvon-martin-attorney-are-we-at-a-point-where-theres-been-a-rush-to-judgment/#comment-480632291</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cs6m7</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
