It is not her fault that she was attacked, but she made several mistakes that could have cost her life in the end -- stopping to fulfill the request (cigarette) of a man at night in an isolated Spot; not yelling when he exposed himself; not alerting store employees; returning to the scene alone; stopping to pick up her purse items after being attacked. Ladies, PLEASE keep your senses about you. Do NOT be afraid to scream at the top of your lungs. Trust your gut, and do not be afraid of hurting stranger&amp;#039;s feelings when you speed past them with your very best &amp;#039;eff &amp;#039; glare. Glad she is safe in the end. Not affiliated, but please read &amp;#039;The Gift of Fear&amp;#039; by Gavin de Becker -- it may save your life. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:28381:127771032</id><idPostId>127771032</idPostId><idBlogId>28381</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:28381</id><idBlogId>28381</idBlogId><link>http://www.komonews.com</link><displayName>KOMO - Seattle, WA</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://lakewood.komonews.com/news/crime/734052-police-woman-sexually-assaulted-wallet-stolen-outside-walgreens</link><displayName>Police: Woman sexually assaulted, wallet stolen outside Walgreens | Crime | Lakewood News</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:34:16.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:28381:127771032:327375123</id><link>http://lakewood.komonews.com/news/crime/734052-police-woman-sexually-assaulted-wallet-stolen-outside-walgreens#IDComment327375123</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:34:16.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Police: Woman sexually assaulted, wallet stolen outside Walgreens | Crime | Lakewood News by TheAppleState</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://intensedebate.com/people/TheAppleState</link><idEmailMd5>549289c88b547ce020dbafdf2a18a2fc</idEmailMd5><displayName>TheAppleState</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/people/TheAppleState"&gt;TheAppleState&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://lakewood.komonews.com/news/crime/734052-police-woman-sexually-assaulted-wallet-stolen-outside-walgreens"&gt;Police: Woman sexually assaulted, wallet stolen outside Walgreens | Crime | Lakewood News&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
