BUT it's from both sides.  Race has become such a big issue with this that there will be NO answer... Race has clouded this case beyond 'getting to the bottom of it'.  I hate that someone is dead... it breaks my heart no matter his color.  I wish race would stop being an issue so that evidence could be truly examined.  Heck, I wish race would stop being an issue  at all... we are all human and deserve to be treated as such.  A person's skin color should not matter, we all Bleed red.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hhzl0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ewhe</id></website><link>http://www.thegrio.com/specials/trayvon-martin/the-thug-ification-of-trayvon-martin-smear-campaign-distracts-from-the-case.php</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T13:21:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T09:32:21+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw5anj</id><link>http://www.thegrio.com/specials/trayvon-martin/the-thug-ification-of-trayvon-martin-smear-campaign-distracts-from-the-case.php#comment-480558843</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzk1b</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
