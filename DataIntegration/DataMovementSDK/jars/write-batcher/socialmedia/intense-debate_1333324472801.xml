Like, it made me think of a Phoenix. I wonder if she's part Daemonfeuer, and part Pheonix or something. She'll probably be back for the "Dirty Dozen" ep that the EPs promised was coming.Â 

I was legit scared when Wu got sprayed with that crap. I love him too much to tolerate them taking him away from me.Â 

Also, word on the show hate, haha. Have you read the one recap of "Glee" that I did a few weeks back? Utter hate storm. Shows take heed: if I love you, I will Shout it from the rooftops. And if I hate you, I don't give a second thought to unleashing my fat spray and lighting fire to your ass ;)</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/68gg7c</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/qbw0</id></website><link>http://offcolortv.com/10699-grimm-this-girl-takes-being-wired-to-a-whole-new-level/</link><postedTime>2012-03-12T15:02:21+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-19T16:59:31+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mj6w78</id><link>http://offcolortv.com/10699-grimm-this-girl-takes-being-wired-to-a-whole-new-level/#comment-469124030</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/d7dnq</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-12</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
