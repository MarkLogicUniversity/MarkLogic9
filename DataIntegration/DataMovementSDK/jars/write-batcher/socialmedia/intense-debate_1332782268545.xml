D Wade and LBJ just plain ole seem uninterested in playing some games and as a result, the rest of the team follows suit. In the mean time, Spoelstra looks-on emotionless as if he has no clue that the team is playing without (even an ounce of) passion. Eric Spoelstra is just not a championship caliber coach, and this team will continue to struggle because of that fact alone!
I personally don't think the Heat will even make it to the finals this year.

If the Heat really want to win a championship with this team they are gonna have to get rid of Spo!...PERIOD!...any real coach would not allow Wade and James to take games Off at their liberty.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rue8k</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yzhx</id></website><link>http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/25/2714030/miami-heat-get-pushed-around-by.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T03:31:39+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T12:28:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkbaq9</id><link>http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/25/2714030/miami-heat-get-pushed-around-by.html#comment-476359766</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cadbc</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
