How about the blacks being killed by blacks, doesn't that make the black panther party want to put a  on the killer(s)?Â  The Martin death investigation is not done yet, already they are judge, jury, and executioner.Â  The FDLE should look into the "Bounty" made by the black panther party because that is illegal and innocent people may get hurt.Â  The family whose house address was tweeted incorrectly by Spike Lee, should sue Lee for assault.Â  I am really surprised the blacks haven't Burnt the town down, that is the way the usually do things. Those attorneys for the Martins are a disgrace also, they too rush to judgement and is not allowing a thorough investigation. For 2012 it seems like we are still in the dark ages.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zlndn</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/o6hq</id></website><link>http://conservativebyte.com/2012/03/dem-pulled-from-house-floor-for-trayvon-hoodie/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:45:57+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T06:03:55+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3wn0v</id><link>http://conservativebyte.com/2012/03/dem-pulled-from-house-floor-for-trayvon-hoodie/#comment-480304060</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6jqv</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
