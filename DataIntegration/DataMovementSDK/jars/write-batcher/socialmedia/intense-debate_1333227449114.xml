 to know that you and Primordial Soup are here and with full .
Â 
Respect of Â windmills power generators the problem is that wind is free,but not Always blows where needed,and when needed. ( BTW , NASA has built ,several years ago a very good one, to experiment ).
Â 
The nuclear plants are not unsafe.

Here we have just only 2, but they havenÂ´t had any problem, ever.
The technology involved is superb. ( A dome at sub-pressure air covering the full factory to avoid a minor leak could go outside to the surroundings,for instance.)

The good thing is that you can place the power plant very near of the area you
need to serve.

Hydrogen can be made through electrolysis, stored ( carefully,is very flammable ) and Burned to make steam and then,moving turbines with the steam, make electricity).

In outer space,
Â SUN is the King. ( photoelectric cells ) similar you know can be used to power residential areas.

May be the cleaner, the waterfall of reservoirs. And a interesting reserve of water.

Planners say that all systems will play a role in the future.
