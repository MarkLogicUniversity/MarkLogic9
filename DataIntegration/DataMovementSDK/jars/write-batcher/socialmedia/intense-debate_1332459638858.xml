According to their stpory, since January 1 of this year through only mid February, Zimmerman had made 46 calls to 911 while &amp;quot;on patrol&amp;quot; - ALL of them about &amp;quot;suspicious black teens in hoodies&amp;quot;.  On the night he shot Martin he was SPECIFICALLY told by the 911 dispatcher to stop following Marttin, to wait for the police to arrive - he disobeyed that directive &amp;amp; responded &amp;quot;these assh)les Always get away&amp;quot; and went after Martin. 
It was Cold blooded murder, nothing else.  Martin was on his cell phone with his GF at the time, telling her about Zimmerman following him, and that he was nervous &amp;amp; afraid of the guy in the car.  I seriously doubt it was &amp;quot;self-defense&amp;quot; as claimed.  Zimmerman left the safety of his SUV to approach &amp;amp; confront Martin; Zimmerman outweighed Martin by at least 100 pounds, and Zimmerman was armed with a weapon - while Martin was &amp;quot;armed&amp;quot; with a can of Arizona Iced Tea &amp;amp; a bage of Skittles.  ALSO, martin was shot in the BACK as he was trying to get away from Zimmerman.  HOW THE HELL CAN HE CLAIM SELF DEFENSE WHEN HE SHOT AN UNARMED TEENAGER IN THE BACK?!?!?!?!?
