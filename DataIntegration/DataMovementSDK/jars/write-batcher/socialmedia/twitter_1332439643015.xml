We can now get away with journalism writing what someone feels "unconsciously" and get away with it?

"Unconsciously, the Republican candidates.. find Obama’s Comfort with nuance so Anxiety provoking that they lash out ..."

You know their unconscious thoughts?  Really?  This could be so much fun!  Let's give it a try:

"Unconsciously, President Obama – fueled by his loss of a father when young – lashes out at Republican candidates with the anger and hatred of a child abandoned, meanwhile Republican presidential candidates are being the adults in the room."  

Oh Boy this is great!! Let's try another one:

Unconsciously, the Democratic leadership in Congress – fueled by the party’s fringe voters – find Republican's obvious leadership qualities so Anxiety provoking that they lash out against Republican positions that require more than the simplified mottos like "Change you can believe in" or "We have to pass it so you can see what is in it."
  
Thank you Time Magazine for the wonderful excuse to state the unconscious thoughts of others with absolutely no adherence to journalistic standards!  

We are going to have lots of fun with this one.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6d9k42</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/bpum</id></website><link>http://ideas.time.com/2012/03/21/what-attacks-on-obama-say-about-the-republican-candidates/</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T12:34:48+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:41:44+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi8kih</id><link>http://ideas.time.com/2012/03/21/what-attacks-on-obama-say-about-the-republican-candidates/#comment-473786293</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lyyxz</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
