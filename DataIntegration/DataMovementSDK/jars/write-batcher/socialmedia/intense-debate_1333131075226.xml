A 2 year old baby sister, two 2 years old nieces, and a newborn niece. I have watch all of them go through skin issues like horrible Itchy rashes all over their body, baby rashes, skin discoloration and my one of my nieces is having reoccuring eczema. My sister keeps using  on her claiming it works, but it  comes back. I don't think that means it's working? 

Since I know the benefits of natural products I've tried over and over to tell my sister to stop using products such as  and Johnson&amp;Johnson on her baby but she's not convinced. She keeps telling me that the products work but I see the skin problems Always reoccuring. I would love your kit to give to my sister so her baby's skin can absorb natural safe products and hopefully her eczema will go away. But the Angel Baby Bottom Balm I would give to the newborn :)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hvx2t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/12fy</id></website><link>http://blog.earthmamaangelbaby.com/fun-with-herbs/win-a-little-something-for-baby</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T15:39:52+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T06:19:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3worh</id><link>http://blog.earthmamaangelbaby.com/fun-with-herbs/win-a-little-something-for-baby#comment-480313561</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
