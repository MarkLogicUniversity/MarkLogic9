The story line is Trayvon, a sweet innocent 12 year old boy, unjustly accused of theft and drug usage was killed in Cold blood by an old fat white guy. 

Never mind the photo of TrayvonÂ was at least 5 years old. 
Never mind Trayvon had been expelled multiple times
Never mind Trayvon had stolen goods with him. 
Never mind Trayvon was evidently kicked out of Mom's house and sent to Dad's.
Never mind Trayvon was 6 foot 3 inch gang banger with an attitude
Never mind Trayvon tweetedÂ about hitting a buss driver
Never mind Trayvon tweeted about abusing women
Never mind Zimmerman was a democrat
Never mind Zimmerman was Hispanic
Never mind the neighborhood had problems with thefts

NEVER MIND THAT THIS TAKES ATTENTION OFF OBAMA'S FAILURES, Obamacare, the economy, out of control budgets, etc. etc. etc.Â  AND PUTS ATTENTION ON RACE FOR THE 2012 ELECTION....
