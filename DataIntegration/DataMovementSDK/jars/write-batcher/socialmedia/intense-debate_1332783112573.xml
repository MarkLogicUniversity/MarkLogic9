Chang's machinations, and possibly the Dean's stupidity will outlaw the group from Greendale turning them into the Greendale 7. We also know there will be a trial, so that may factor into it too. Thus, S4 could conceivably start with the group on the run, or trying to make their way back into the college. Troy may finally fall under Laybourne's spell. The Dean may end up demoted or fired. Chang will be either subdued and carried Off to the asylum, Joker-style, or in some way used by Laybourne (personally, I like the first possibility better - he could undergo a soul rezoning over the summer and return).
