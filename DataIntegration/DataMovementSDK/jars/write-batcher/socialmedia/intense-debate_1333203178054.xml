When he enters the room, he doesn't even say a simple "hello" or even look at you, for that matter--he simply sits down at the computer with his back turned &amp; begins to brusquely ask questions.Â  I believe in common courtesy--so when I politely asked if he  does this, he replied, "I'm just trying to get to this Back pain issue...do I come  as standoffish?" When I answered yes, there was no apology--just a, "Well, it might be a problem for YOU, but that's just the way it is."Â  I was speechless, like WOW.Â  I told him there'd be no need for treatment, promptly left and called my credit card company to dispute my copay charge as soon as I got home.Â  Docs, your years of med school don't give you carte blanche to Act like a**holes...especially when we're paying you our hard-earned money! </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/8becy9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/e3f7</id></website><link>http://www.lifescript.com/doctor-directory/orthopedic-surgeon/fairfield-connecticut-ct-joel-w-malin-md.aspx</link><postedTime>2010-10-18T16:28:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:09:44+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwl13a</id><link>http://www.lifescript.com/doctor-directory/orthopedic-surgeon/fairfield-connecticut-ct-joel-w-malin-md.aspx#comment-480962341</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2010-10-18</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
