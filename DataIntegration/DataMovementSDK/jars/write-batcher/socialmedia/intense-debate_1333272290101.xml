Religion falsely claims the absolute truth.Â  Truth is relative to perspective.Â  Try it;Â  using both eyes, locate an object;Â  Align a third item with it.Â  Then realign the third item with the distal object as you alternate focusing on it with each eye, in turn.Â  Having to move the intermediate object is an example of parallax and relative truth.Â  The truth is the alignment changes as visual perspective changes.
This isn't theology, philosophy or philology;Â  this is an exercise, a symboilic exercise
Thanks for being interested.Â  I'm not trying to change you.Â  These are emotional issues.Â  It is nearly impossible to address emotion with logic.Â  Emotion and logic are oil and water.Â  An emulsion is dependant upon a catalyst;Â  it is a transitional state and requires constant agitation, Heat and exposure to the catalytic agent.
