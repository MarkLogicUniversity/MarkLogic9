I've also heard it advanced by Biblical scholars that one of God's 'days' is a period of 150,000,000 or so years.

Which still puts them Off by an order of magnitude or something, but at least they're closer to the mark.

The funny part is, as observed above, there needn't be any conflict at all between belief in a compassionate God and and acknowledging the validity of scientific discovery. After all, astronomers still haven't the Faintest notion as to why the Big Bang happened, or what was here beforeâ€”and in fact the whole concept of 'before' is pretty meaningless when you're talking about all of time and space. Why would God not be the creating force of the Universe? How does that contradict the evidence?

But no, Creationists (and, to an extent, Intelligent Designers) still cling to a completely ridiculous set of myths that have no more evidence or validity than the Sumerian's assertion that the world was made from a discarded celestial jizz-rag.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zzdur</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/in-the-hands-of-the-prophets,71184/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:00:36+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:34:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3xmn1</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/in-the-hands-of-the-prophets,71184/#comment-479680152</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ye8se</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
