Gunshot to the Head

            

            Linda  Burnett, 23, a resident of San Diego, 
was visiting her in-laws and while there went to a nearby supermarket to pick up 
some groceries. Later, her husband noticed her sitting in her car in the 
driveway with the windows rolled up and with her eyes closed, with both hands 
behind the back of her head.

            

            He became concerned and walked over to the car. 
He noticed that Linda's eyes were now open and she looked very 
strange.

            


            He asked her if she was okay, and Linda replied 
that she had been shot in the back of the head and had been holding her brains 
in for over an hour. The husband called the paramedics, who broke into the car 
because the doors  were locked and Linda refused to remove her hands from her 
head. When they finally got in, they found that Linda had a wad of bread dough 
on the back of her head. A  biscuit canister had exploded from the 
Heat, making a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot, and the wad of dough hit 
her in the back of her head. When she Reached back to find out what it was, she 
felt the dough and thought it was her brains. She initially passed out, but 
quickly recovered.

            

            Linda is a blonde, a Democrat, and an Obama 
supporter, but that could all be a coincidence. The defective  biscuit canister 
was analyzed and the expiration date was from 2008, so it was determined to be 
Bush's  fault.
