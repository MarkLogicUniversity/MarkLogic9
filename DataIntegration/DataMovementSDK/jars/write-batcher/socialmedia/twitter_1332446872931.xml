How did they improve exactly in the rotation. They don't have a legitimate lead Off hitter and they have a bunch of questions marks in the rotation as well as some players coming back from injury, who are currently injured or battling valley freakin' Fever. 

I think 75 wins could be generous given this squad. I'm not saying they are going to lose 110 games, but how could anyone pick them to finish anything but last?
