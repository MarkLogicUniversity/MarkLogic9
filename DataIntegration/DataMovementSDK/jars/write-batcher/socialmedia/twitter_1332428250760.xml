Dear President Obama,



I often wonder after one of these debates you, Boehner, and Reid, lie in bed, gently sharing a cigarette, and ask the open question, â€œWas it good for you?â€&#157;Â  Because, Mr. Obama it wasnâ€™t good for the American people, frankly, we are left wanting.Â  We got the aggravation, but no action.Â  He!!, we canâ€™t even have a cigarette anymore to calm our nerves.Â  Frankly, Sir, I donâ€™t smoke, but even I could use a cancer stick about now.Â  In fact if I could buy America one thing, other than a Coke, it would be a cigarette and place to smoke it free from some goody-two-shoes telling them to put it out.



Towards the end of this debate I was likened to a terrorist by Joe Biden.Â  This coming from a guy from the same party that has sit downs with real terrorist like Basher Assad.Â  I, and no one Iâ€™ve ever met who wants government to be even marginally more responsible, is a terrorist.Â  If I thought they were I would call my friend in the FBI and ask him if I should report the situation.Â  We are regular people who have credit cards who think that when the bank sets a limit, itâ€™s for a good reason, and if we want an increase we have to justify it and they have to make a determination based on past experience.Â  In this present case the American people determined that enough was enough, and it was time to stop the Bleeding and save good old Uncle Sam from an early demise.



For this we are vilified.Â  We are called racists.Â  We are likened to the deepest evils to have ever roamed the earth.Â  Just because we want to gently and wisely begin to affix a bandage to our Uncle Sam and get him back on his feet while not billing taxpayers for that 5th pair of orthotics that he could pick up at a local Walgreens for far less cost.Â  We do not want to end these programs that tens of millions of Americans and some future Americans rely on.Â  We want to save them.Â  We want to create a better way for the next generation to save for retirement and their eventual infirmity.Â  We want to have family and faith and not government at the center of their lives.Â  We want community not to be organized around race or economic class, but comity and common purpose.



Are these pipe dreams?Â  Maybe.Â  But they are worth the fight.Â  They are worth an argument, and they certainly are worth a few hurt feelings.Â  One of the reasons we all fight so hard is because we are Americans and we find losing hateful.Â  In this most recent debate and vote Americans, once again, lost against a stacked deck.Â  Some day soon we are going to take that deck and shuffle it a few extra times and we are going to be certain those cards hit face down.Â  A casino is the place for gambling, the federal government is not the proper venue especially when lives are on the line.Â  Last November we said enough is enough on November 6, 2012 we will do it again.Â  If my math is right youâ€™ll be short a few more Democrats, and Iâ€™ll be showing a few more Republicans of the TEA Party variety.Â  Thatâ€™s a deck â€œWe The Peopleâ€&#157; canâ€™t wait to play with:)



Respectfully,
