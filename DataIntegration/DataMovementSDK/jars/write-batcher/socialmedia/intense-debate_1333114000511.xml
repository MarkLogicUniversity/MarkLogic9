Anyway..While I agree with you,I really do understand that some people simply don't like Cas.There are other very popular,beloved characters that I can't stand.
But you know what I would love more than anything.When a decision is made about whether Cas will be in season 8 or not(and I strongly believe that he will be),it'd be great if people got everything out of their system once and then moved on.
Because frankly,hearing about something over and over again is getting kind of tiresome.Not everyone can be happy about every single decision the writers are making.I can't even count the number of times I've read that "the angel arc should have ended in season 5".It didn't,it's done,move on...

Also,yeah,the argument "what would he do" is kind of weird..We're talking about a show called "Supernatural".There are endless possibilities..</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rszh3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/g6o1</id></website><link>http://www.spoilertv.com/2012/03/latest-from-kristin-various-shows-26th.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T13:26:31+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-27T13:21:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/msdmkj</id><link>http://www.spoilertv.com/2012/03/latest-from-kristin-various-shows-26th.html#comment-477394407</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/abavo</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
