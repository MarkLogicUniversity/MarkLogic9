Also, even if he didn't. He targeted, at the very least, someone that was innocent of wrong doing AT THAT TIME. No matter what your belief of the actions after that, you have to concede that point.Â 
He said Martin was high, which he was not. He said he was checking out houses, which he was not. He said that Martin was "looking around suspiciously" and then staring at Zimmerman himself.Â 
OF COURSE HE WAS! He could tell someone was watching him and he didn't know from where, that's when he Spotted Zimmerman. For him to make these untrue assumptions, that alone proves bias, even if its not racial. From that point, its not even close to a stretch to think that maybe it was a racial slur. "They Always get away".
