From where I stand I Always had the distinct sense that nobody likes Osborne, nobody liked him the day he entered the Cabinet. Leftists can't stand him because, well, he's a Tory, Lib Dems in so far they are not covered by the leftist tag don't like him because they are stuck working with him and catch Heat for everything he does,Â  Tories don't like him because he's not much of a Tory. 

The commonly held idea that he's a bit of a chinless wonder never really aided his quest for popularity either. If Cameron stepped down ans Osborne replaced him, he'd be the least popular PM in a long time. More disliked than Brown even.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/663b1s</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/9164088/Budget-2012-George-Osbornes-reputation-has-taken-a-serious-knock.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-24T19:03:44+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:17:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkfed4</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/9164088/Budget-2012-George-Osbornes-reputation-has-taken-a-serious-knock.html#comment-476505810</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dj136</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
