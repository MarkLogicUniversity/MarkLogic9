please tell the producers and the writers either to have a sequel to this drama series or add another episode with a happy ending. yes life is sad, but there is Always a BRIGHT BLUE SKY, BEHIND THE NIMBUS CLOUDY SKY.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/cbdsyl</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/hbnr</id></website><link>http://www.mysoju.com/queen-of-reversals/</link><postedTime>2011-01-30T05:30:09+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-02-07T08:35:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/8lvlq0</id><link>http://www.mysoju.com/queen-of-reversals/#comment-141850511</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5dlcu</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-01-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
