Only thing is the apparition of Christian to Jack in the hospital after he left the island. I questioned it as well but remember that the MiB could not leave the island. He could've turned that donkey wheel like a roulette wheel and he would never have travelled  anywhere coz the rules didn't allow it.

It's long been thought that Jack saw nothing but a drug-hazed hallucination. He was at the peak of his prescription drug addiction (as evidenced by his asking of the other dr that turns up for a new prescription). The writers were very clever about playing with our minds in that scene too... Did you notice a smoke alarm goes Off just before we see the Christian-apparition. Creepy! ;)</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/y2s0iu</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gvov</id></website><link>http://lostpolls.blogspot.com/2012/01/least-effective-death-on-lost.html</link><postedTime>2012-01-19T21:18:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-01-23T21:24:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/e3vli7</id><link>http://lostpolls.blogspot.com/2012/01/least-effective-death-on-lost.html#comment-418987527</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/l8w1u</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-01-19</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
