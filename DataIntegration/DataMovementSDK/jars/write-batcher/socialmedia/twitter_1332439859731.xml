This show has been on lifesupport for the last few seasons, and it's clear to me no one running the show knows what the hell to do with it without Steve Carell.  Time to pull the plug. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yu9vp</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/today-in-potential-omens-of-the-offices-demise-pau,71320/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:39:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T17:46:02+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi8w4c</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/today-in-potential-omens-of-the-offices-demise-pau,71320/#comment-473789739</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dovvy</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
