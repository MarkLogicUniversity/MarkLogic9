And since I have absolutely no use for a party which strives not to lead, nor to do what is best for the country, but instead to determine which policies are the most faddishly popular of the day and then adhere to them like glue, I am Glad to see the Liberals Bleeding support.

Let us have a clear choice between the Left and the Right, with the positions of each as well-articulated, publicized, and defended as possible. Â Let each be represented by a cohesive party with an effective leader. Â And then let Canadians make a free choice. Â That is honest democracy, and while we on the Right are nowhere near that ideal for our side, it looks to me like the NDP is making positive steps to achieve it for the Left. Â Sso good on them, and may Mr. Mulcair continue with the drive and eloquence with which he seems to have started.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67a28u</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/r11g</id></website><link>http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/03/30/get-ready-for-beethoven-vs-nickelback/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T10:31:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:16:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwbswb</id><link>http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/03/30/get-ready-for-beethoven-vs-nickelback/#comment-481439326</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hxhrf</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
