BACKGROUND


My beloved wife sold of my car without my knowledge and consent by
faking my signatures; and when she was confronted with the crime; she threatened
me with 498a first and then filed a complaint under the DV  to protect
herself.


Â 


She is an MBA from a premier institute and draws handsome salary.
We were married for 16 yrs.

JUDICIAL TERRORISM 


Prima facie, domestic violence  appears to be a blessing for people
in abusive marriages. However, a careful analysis shows that, under the ploy of
â€œwomen and child welfareâ€&#157;, the Domestic Violence  (PWDVA) and 498a are a
blatant and biased attempt to grant women legal supremacy and to create a
society where men are deprived of even basic human rights. The biggest
fundamental problem with this law is the potential for misuse. While woman who
are really abused in our country remain unaware of these laws; highly educated feminists
are filing false cases at the drop of a hat for ulterior motives and . The
DV  singles out men as perpetrators of domestic violence since only a woman
can file a complaint on her partner while a male has no such rights. Ironically
it has been comprehensively proven that women are no less abusive in intimate
relationships. On the contrary when men retaliate; the feminists and their support
groups start crying fowl since their egos canâ€™t digest a taste of their own
dirty medicines and designs. Even the Supreme Court has commented on the
rampant misuse of these laws and sought suitable amendments.


Â 


Deceitfully and fraudulently selling- husbandâ€™s car and then
seeking Protection and maintenance under DV ? Which case is the actual
rebuttal? Who is committing the actual domestic and financial violence within
the marriage? Who is the real victim? Who is misusing the law? These questions
are best left to the readers to understand. The real answers will Always be
hidden beneath the heap of trash that is being Coughed-up by these fraudulent
feminists and their family-breaking supporters who are not even worth the salt
that they eat from the ill-gotten wealth which they deceitfully consider their
own. In America, women shudder to level false allegations since they know that
they would be rotting in prison in no time for the rest of their lives and that
too as a pauper. Such is the fairness of the Gender Laws in the USA.


Â 


No doubt the laws are bound to be amended in India too. Look at
the media and cyber space where so much is being written against them. Unfair
deprivation, harassment and atrocity cannot last forever. Look at world
history. Even the Indian Judiciary is now well versed with this new breed of
litigants who come to the court with unclean hands and are thus very careful in
passing unreasonable orders. Allegations are eventually never proven; in fact
they were never levelled to be proven in the 1st place. They were
only levelled to extract money thru maintenance and out of court settlements.
Our children need better values and traditions so that they can lead happy and
fruitful lives in future. What morals on earth can such feminists teach their
children after having lived their own lives in deceit, fraud and complete
denial of it. The Judiciary knows that men are retaliating and are forced to
arm themselves with better knowledge than the law-abuser whose euphoria &amp;
false sense of victory is soon shed after a few dates itself in the court.
Lower courts may inadvertently overlook key facts of the case while passing
orders but one should not rest till the law-abuser is dragged in honâ€™ble High Courts
and Supreme Court of India.
