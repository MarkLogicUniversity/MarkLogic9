yep.

not sure why all you dolts (CNN included) think 'extent of Zimmerman's injuries' is even relevant.

both eye witnesses (the rest all heard, not saw) agree Zimmerman was on his back, and Trayvon was above him and striking him.

this is why Zimmerman walks.

not because his nose "Bled enough".
