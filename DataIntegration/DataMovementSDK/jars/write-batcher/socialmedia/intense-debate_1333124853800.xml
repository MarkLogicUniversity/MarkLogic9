I would much rather talk baseball with the boys over there, Fergie, Halo Pride, Arch, Macleod, Donny and the rest of them.Â 
I think all trolls are bad. I know I'm being a slight hypocrite with that statement considering what I'm doing. But whatever.Â And I'm self employed. I have an internet marketing company that makes plenty of money whether I work or not. I love baseball, I Bleed Angel Red.. Which is why I want my dang forum back.Â 
NotArch, I don't want to tell ya what to do. But it sure would be cool if you stopped trolling these boards IF GIIVEEMCLAWANTLER stops trolling our boards. Again, there is nothing I can do to stop ya.. Just a humble request so we can get back to talking Angel baseball and these guys can get back to talking Ranger ball.
It's one thing to talk a little smack every now and then. It's a whole other to troll.Â It's just a request notArch.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zfkqj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27742440%26vkey=news_tex%26c_id=tex</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:07:30+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:03:46+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ss33</id><link>http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27742440%26vkey=news_tex%26c_id=tex#comment-480226245</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zhui2</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
