the second half of the 90 minutes I was back in the groove.  It seems to
me this season is about cranking up the  on everyone's personality
traits.  Sterling is more Sterling, Campbell is more Campbell.  Also,
the Heat seemed to play an interesting role.  I could see a DO THE RIGHT
THING type gimmick where the temperature gets hotter as tensions rise.  Maybe
that’s too on the nose for Wiener?  The only person who seemed less
himself was Don, which is probably a sign of what's to come.  If I had to
guess, he will snap out of the Megan thing once he realizes the company is on
the verge of failing.  He will Gain control at the cost of losing
her.  But alone and bitter is kind of Don's sweet Spot.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l2r3g</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6jwz</id></website><link>http://www.badassdigest.com/2012/03/26/tv-talk-mad-men-51-a-little-kiss</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:36:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:11:22+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk98ki</id><link>http://www.badassdigest.com/2012/03/26/tv-talk-mad-men-51-a-little-kiss#comment-476548122</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dj5fj</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
