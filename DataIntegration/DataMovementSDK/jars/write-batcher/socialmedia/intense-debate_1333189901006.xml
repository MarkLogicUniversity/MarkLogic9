Forget about his lead playing for a moment, his rhythm &amp; timing alone make him so damn fun to listen to! Tracks like "Girl Gone Bad".."Romeo Delight"..intro to "Mean Street"..intro to "Women In Love".."As Is" &amp; "China Town" Off the new album. Still to this day, nobody sounds just like him &amp; as soon as he plays you KNOW it's Ed. Sure, there are imitators/shredders but they all fall flat &amp; try to squeeze a million notes &amp; scales in there without any feeling. It all ends up sounding like Diarrhea of the fretboard to me. His Beat It solo, that the writer mentions, is a great example...short, sweet &amp; explosive without taking anything away from the song. "Push Comes to Shove" &amp; "One Foot Out the Door" are some of Ed's finest solos ever!   

Eddie Van Halen is a guitar legend &amp; I'm happy as hell to be seeing him again on tour this year!  :D </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zklg8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/fbtm</id></website><link>http://www.vhnd.com/2012/03/29/preview-how-great-is-eddie-van-halen/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T05:37:42+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:22:28+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwl08y</id><link>http://www.vhnd.com/2012/03/29/preview-how-great-is-eddie-van-halen/#comment-480975489</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
