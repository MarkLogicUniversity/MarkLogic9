I  enjoy myself when I go out, but I often wouldn't work up the gumption to go if my friends didn't pressure me into it. Same with trips, the minute before leaving I  attempt to punk out, and I probably would if I didn't have a friendly foot on my butt pushing me out the door. Although I largely agree with your piece on consent, I would argue that helping friends out of their Comfort zones can be a good thing.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yxwxr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/twef</id></website><link>http://www.thefrisky.com/2012-03-22/the-soapbox-on-consent-culture/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T16:12:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T18:08:51+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/michct</id><link>http://www.thefrisky.com/2012-03-22/the-soapbox-on-consent-culture/#comment-473808653</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zd7fn</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
