It was very sad seeing the Grande Ballroom as it is now.Â 

One thing about Detroit, there was Always plenty of truly talented people there and lots and lots of high energy rock 'n roll!Â 

I've heard from tons of bands that played Detroit about how much energy the audiences there had. A band Burned out from touring would hit Detroit and suddenly find themselves renewed by way fans greeted them and dig down deep and come up with amazing performances. You only have to look at how many bands recorded live albums in Detroit.Â 

Very happy that this movie was made and wish it every success.Â 

And I hope that it makes it to DVD so I can go and get myself another shot of that unique Grande Ballroom energy!Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hcc2k</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/d535</id></website><link>http://metrotimes.com/music/ain-t-love-grande-1.1291093</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T04:11:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:28:33+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3shvv</id><link>http://metrotimes.com/music/ain-t-love-grande-1.1291093#comment-480200992</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
