"Plouton" (Cough-notacoincidence-Cough) was a god of wealth, explaining the money obsession. That or they're referencing a rock and I don't get it at all.

Ha, you make it sound like someone got knocked up by a female ox, which even Greek gods would consider a little odd! As for "Minos" it means "king" but Wikipedia says its speculated to mean "ascetic", and avoidance of worldly pleasures is something I guess a balloon-thing does quite well in a literal sense? Yep, clutching at straws. Ahem. HEY! Isn't Rokman more like a two-armed Graveller? A mid-form between the two, like when a tadpole has just the Hind legs, perhaps?</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ei0dq</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/arl0</id></website><link>http://www.bogleech.com/icarus2.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-19T06:54:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T00:35:22+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miytem</id><link>http://www.bogleech.com/icarus2.html#comment-474093871</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rlxxe</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-19</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
