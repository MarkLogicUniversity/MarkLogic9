I was up and walking around that same night with no problems at all. My pain level was very low (and I am a HUGE wimp with pain) and my Comfort level was pretty good. Sure, it was uncomfortable at times (like when I had to Cough or Sneeze) but I thought it was a breeze. My sister also had a very easy recovery from both of her C-sections. I can say that from talking with those who had vaginal births, that they had tons of pain and cramping... where I didn't. I would do it again in a heart beat. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z7xqu</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/71js</id></website><link>http://www.people.com//people/article/0,,20582782,00.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:00:12+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:49:00+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3sfaq</id><link>http://www.people.com//people/article/0,,20582782,00.html#comment-480216007</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
