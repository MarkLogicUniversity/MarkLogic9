This team is the league whipping boy along with Columbus (run into the sewer by Lowe protege Scott Howson).

Keep making excuses for this losing organization. The finish to this season is shaping up to be another fizzle and leads into another losing campaign next season. All I ever hear are excuses propping up management and coaching and on the pillars of patience and "rebuild"...and in the meantime, another bottom 5 finish and probably second last. Only one Spot better than last season. Who keeps signing and playing the "under-performing" players? This team continues to spin its wheels.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67b551</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7maa</id></website><link>http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/03/31/oilers-need-to-get-it-right</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T04:51:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:27:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwkyck</id><link>http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/03/31/oilers-need-to-get-it-right#comment-481828315</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gqz9m</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
