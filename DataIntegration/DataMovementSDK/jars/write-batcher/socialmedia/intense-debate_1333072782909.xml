The Threat Within (Voting ourselves largesse from the 
public treasury)

2008-11-14By Dr. Mark W. 
HendricksonÂ (Please note the date, this was 5 weeks after Obama won the last Presidential election, wonder what Dr Hendrickson knew?)

Human nature has a blind Spot. We often detect external flaws faster than 
internal onesâ€”seeing the speck in our neighborâ€™s eye sooner than the beam in our 
own, to use the biblical metaphor. 
This same tendency exists at the national level. Such blindness can be fatal, 
as Ralph Waldo Emerson warned when he wrote, â€œA nation never falls but by 
suicide.â€&#157; In America today, we readily perceive the dangers posed by 
international terrorism, hostile foreign regimes, uncontrolled immigration, the 
global narco-gangsters, etc. It is the threat within that seems to be Off the 
radar screen. 
The fall of Rome and other dominant civilizations manifest similar 
pathologiesâ€”imperial overreach, runaway spending, erosion of moneyâ€™s purchasing 
power, personal debauchery. At the most fundamental level, national suicide 
follows moral decay. Hard work, thrift, deferring self-gratification, 
self-relianceâ€”the individual virtues that enable people to prosper and 
civilizations to thriveâ€”fade away. They are supplanted by self-indulgence, 
borrowing from the future to live it up today, refusal to accept personal 
responsibility, and wanting something for nothing, even at the expense of 
innocent others. 
Sad to say, there are signs of such rot, such weakness of character, all 
around us today. Our nation is drowning in debt. Our culture is increasingly 
ignoble and hedonisticâ€”people would rather read about Brittany Spears and Paris 
Hilton than Michael Monsoor and Ross McGinnis (two Congressional Medal of Honor 
winners who gave their lives in Iraq). Many Americans are afflicted with a sense 
of entitlement, believing that â€œsocietyâ€&#157; owes them a living and that they 
shouldnâ€™t have to work to improve themselves. Millions want to feed at the 
government trough rather than put forth the necessary years of effort to succeed 
on their own. They demand ever-larger handouts from Washingtonâ€”that is, from 
their fellow citizens who pay taxes. 
So widespread is the insidious belief that individuals have an inherent 
â€œrightâ€&#157; to government support that politicians are locked into a permanent 
search for ways to confiscate more wealth from more people. Private propertyâ€”the 
basis for so many other human rights, and the indispensable prerequisite for 
social prosperity, indeed, the very key to our countryâ€™s economic successâ€”is 
under siege and our future at risk. 
Anecdotes illustrating this moral rot abound. The most memorable I ever heard 
was during the Whitewater scandal, when the possibility was raised that Bill 
Clinton had defrauded the American taxpayer. At a public presidential 
appearance, a woman called out from a crowd, â€œDonâ€™t you worry about Whitewater, 
Bill, just keep our welfare checks coming!â€&#157; Translation: â€œSteal if you want, Mr. 
President; just give me my own little piece of something-for-nothing.â€&#157; 
Recently (on Oct. 17, to be exact) radio talk-show host Sean Hannity asked 
callers to say why they favored Obama for president. What followed was a 
depressing succession of people saying that Obama would give them more money, 
free health care, and other goodies. Totally forgotten was DemocraticÂ President 
Kennedyâ€™s appeal, â€œAsk not what your country can do for you â€¦â€&#157; In its place was 
the piggish attitude, â€œI want it. Promise to give it to me and my vote is 
yours.â€&#157;Â So you see sir Vigilantcitizen our Country is in big trouble and I'm not so darn sure there are enough of us responsible, tax paying citizens that love our Countryand have self esteem; Â to overcome those who line up voting for freebies and that's a dam shame!
