You&amp;#039;re Always advocating for violence, against Christians usually.  You like vigilante justice and don&amp;#039;t see why a rule of law needs to be followed.  
  
You lecture me on manners?  You?  
  
That&amp;#039;s funny.  
  
You want to use hate speech and avoid reality and I make sure you are exposed when you do that.  This is a war as long as you are at war against the values I hold dear and have made this country great. 
 
Now, in the nicest possible way, are you going to quit attacking Christianity and saying that Hitler was evil due to his Christian beliefs amongst other things, like that Christians should be Burned alive in their churches?
