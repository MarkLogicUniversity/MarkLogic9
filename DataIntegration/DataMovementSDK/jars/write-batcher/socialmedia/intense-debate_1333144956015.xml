On a side note.  Why would A.P stay in St.Louis without a D.H. when his age is suspect?  He gets to wear the same colors and have better weather and a D.H. Spot warm for him later on. Not to mention possible promo money from the number 2 market?  I hate St.Louis more than you guys and your in Cleveland's League.  
They are so smug with their "most W.S." in the N.L.  Big deal.  Hot, Crime ridden, big gross Midwestern Girls.  They think they are the N.L Yankees let's see this year.
Good luck over all except when playing the Tribe.  I only really don't like Texas in your division. So obviously last years world series was painful to watch.
