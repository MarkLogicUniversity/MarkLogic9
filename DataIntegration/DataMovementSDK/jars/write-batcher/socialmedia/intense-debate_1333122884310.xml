Watching Milton Friedman's "Free to Choose" on PBS made me a conservative - so I'll Always have a soft Spot from PBS even though I want to defund it.

Y'all might want to look at the following RedState article I am linking to.  It shows that there is a real difference in values between conservatives and liberals.  Conservatives have more of 'em.  Conservatives also understand liberals pretty well while liberals don't understand conservatives - primarily because conservatives have three values that liberals do not: loyalty, respect for authority and sanctity.

When have you ever heard a liberal properly describe a conservative position and yet still advocate the liberal one?  It is rare indeed.

Anyway, here is the link:
