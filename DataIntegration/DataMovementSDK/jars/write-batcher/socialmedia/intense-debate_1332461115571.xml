1. His wife/girlfriend is "trapping" him into the relationship with a baby he doesn't want; likely because
i) he doesn't want to be a father
ii) he feels she's manipulating him with the pregnancy
iii) the baby will take her attention  him and give her a reason to want to protect someone besides just him.

2. He is attracted to the mental construct of a woman who has never borne children, and her having a baby would break this. Optionally, he may be physically attracted to the body shape generally associated with women who aren't pregnant and may believe that she would be unattractive during pregnancy and/or after it if her body fails to shed the weight Gain associated with pregnancy.
