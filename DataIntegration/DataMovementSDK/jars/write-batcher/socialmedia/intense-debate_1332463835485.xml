This board is not a discussion of the ADHD disorder, but it is as real and challenging as other disorders, just not well understood. Only a few decades ago asthma was thought to be psychosomatic as were migraine Headaches. Now they are both understood to have a  basis (and in the case of migraines, a full body, multiple-day syndrome for each occurence). Science is constantly changing as we make new discoveries. As we learn more about ASD, we will modify and clarify our understanding and diagnoses. The process is Always in flux. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6d34k7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4te3</id></website><link>http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/03/21/the-rise-of-autism-social-contagion-or-environmental-causation/</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T17:44:48+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-21T21:09:21+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mpt495</id><link>http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/03/21/the-rise-of-autism-social-contagion-or-environmental-causation/#comment-472789516</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
