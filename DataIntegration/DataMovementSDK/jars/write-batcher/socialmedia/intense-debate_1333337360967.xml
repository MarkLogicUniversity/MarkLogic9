France has a fracking Ban, Exxon's results on shale gas in Poland have been very disappointing, shale gas producers in the US are going broke. All the huge oil shale deposits you talk about have not produced 1 barrel of commercial oil, although there have been many experimental schemes. The shale oil resources in the Bakken and Eagle Ford and also in California have less than 25 billion barrels - it is true that this is very high quality oil but the world Burns 31 billion barrels per year.

In short a totally misinformed article - the sort I would expect from Mr. Reyolds over at the Globe and Mail. I'm going to have to revise downward the proportion of what I believe that I read in the popular press to less than 10% from its current 20%.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67qbf0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ni28</id></website><link>http://opinion.financialpost.com/2012/03/30/lawrence-solomon-a-world-awash-in-oil/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:33:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T16:49:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mww1tv</id><link>http://opinion.financialpost.com/2012/03/30/lawrence-solomon-a-world-awash-in-oil/#comment-481988212</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
