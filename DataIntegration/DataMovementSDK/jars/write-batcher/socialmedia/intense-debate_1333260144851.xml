Myrtle (clucking her tongue):  "Oh, dear lord!  Look at the one in the center (squints over her readers)  Who in the he// is that?"

Ethyl: ( her companion, zeros in on the middle mule):  "Mmmm...sakes alive...that's crazy Aunt Nancy Pelosi.  She look like she got hit by the ugly tree!  An looky there..."Ja'MULE Green!"

They both collapse in laughter

Myrtle (eye's out on sticks):  "She look like a tuna, sho' 'nuff.  No wonder they call 'er the 'Tuna Queen'.  Heaven and Earth!  Look at the mess over there.  I believe that's Debbie Wasserman-Schultz." (takes Off her glasses to clean them for a better look).

Ethyl:  (cranes her neck):  "Uh, huh.  Or mebbe it's Ed Schultz.  I can't tell'em apart.  They both have such big mouths and 5:00 shadows."

Myrtle:  "Look...there's Shelia Jackson Lee.  Oh mercy, she is fat, shoooooweeee!  What in he// she got on?  The shower curtains?"

Ethyl: "OMG!  Look at Ruth Bader Ginsberg.  Is she alive even?  I've seen stick matches bigger 'round that that thing.  And there's Barbara Boxer.  She a dog!  So good last name for her.  And looky there at Streisand.  She look like she got caught p'ing on the railroad track and the train wouldn't stop! (They're over the moon, laughing)  Oh, lordy...and look.  Susan Estritch!  That's some ugly.  She look like an Ostritch, fa' shore!

Myrtle:  "Shore do.  And looky there.  Hillary. Whew...that donkey been rode hard, aint' it?   I love it when she fall up the steps on an air plane!  There's that Rachel Maddow.  I bet she can change a tire in two minutes flat, with no problem.  And Claire McCaskill...what'chu wanna pick out the ugliest glasses on teh wall for and then put 'em on that face?  She an expense report cheat too.  Tsk, tsk.  I could teach 'em all how ta' balance a checkbook."

Ethyl:  "They don't want to know, baby...they 'Corrupto'crats'.  Save ya'sef from wastin' ya' time.  Oh, and look there....Rosie O'Donnell.  She makes me hurl.  And Janet Reno.  Good God 'a'mighty!'  She look like my first cousiin Ralph.  He a lumberjack.  An' there's Sebelius.  She give me chills (looks at her friend)  She do, I 'aint lyin'.  Right down ta' my toes.  Brrrrrrrr!  And there's  Janet Napolitano.  I bet she could arm wrestle her way out of a tight Spot.  Come to think of it, she in one.  Let's get outta here darlin', a fore we lose our appetites.  

Myrtle:  "I'm with ya on that.  Say darlin', how's come you spell Ethel with a 'y'.  

Ethyl:  (giggles)  "Ethyl is purtier.  These day's Ethyl costs more than Rubies, know what I mean?  I'm just so proud I can still afford my ObamaGas, I done changed it ta' Ethyl!"

Myrtle:  "Well I can't.  Let's take your car."</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67dtg1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/politics/2012/03/30/democrats-disarray</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:39:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:38:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwbhaw</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/politics/2012/03/30/democrats-disarray#comment-481413526</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8nldh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
