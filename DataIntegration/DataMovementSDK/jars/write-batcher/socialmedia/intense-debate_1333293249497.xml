Whiteside needs to be  the roster as well. Pill has to make the team. We need a right handed hitter. He should platoon with Belt or Huff at first. Gregor Blanco deserves to make the team and be the leadoff hitter. Pagan did not hit well last year and is having a tough spring. I think he competes with Belt and Schierholtz. If Blanco slips and Pagan Heats up, then make that switch. Either way, you have speed on power on the bench. The problem is we have mostly lefties and switch hitters. Pagan at least gives you a switch hitter coming Off the bench when he does.You could steal a lot of bases if Blanco, Pagan, Burriss, and Cabrera are all in the lineup. You would have 3 Cf's playing defense in a big outfield. The problem is you have to be getting lots of pop and RBI's from the infield. Defensively, they should be good.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67lwe5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27760004%26vkey=news_sf%26c_id=sf</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:13:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T08:58:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwjpwe</id><link>http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120330%26content_id=27760004%26vkey=news_sf%26c_id=sf#comment-481668702</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c09g3</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
