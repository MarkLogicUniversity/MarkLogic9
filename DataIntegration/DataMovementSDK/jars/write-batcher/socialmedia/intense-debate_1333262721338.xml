If the arguement is that he wouldn't cover the Republican Primaries, the only reason to cover them is to see what idiocy the audiece came up with from booing a vet to Cheering the death penelity.  Oberman hit the high Spots and when on with the s--- that the Repugs were pulling behind the scenes.  The only failing of Obermans was not enough coverage of Wisconsin and Walker.  Other then that, hes the top dog.  Hire him back before someone else does.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/677fa7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/cbcl</id></website><link>http://www.theatlanticwire.com/business/2012/03/so-where-does-keith-olbermann-go-now/50584/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T22:28:26+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T02:14:06+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwbk9n</id><link>http://www.theatlanticwire.com/business/2012/03/so-where-does-keith-olbermann-go-now/50584/#comment-481437740</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/5ubwk</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
