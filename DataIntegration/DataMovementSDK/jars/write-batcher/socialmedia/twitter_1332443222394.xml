His Cold heartedness towards Bill when he was telling him how had to work for everything was shameful. All Colten did was roll his eyes again. OMG that little creep.Â 
The good part of all of this, Ask Russel Hanson how being the villain worked out for him. Not so good. People had absolutely no respect for him when he returned home and he lost relationships with many family members. Colten is in for a huge awakening when he gets back into the real world. The people who will reject him and he will be booed out of restaurants, stores, and anywhere he goes. Ask him how his behavior paid Off for him in three months.Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ezhend</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/npji</id></website><link>http://www.starpulse.com/Television/Survivor/</link><postedTime>2011-08-15T21:09:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-08T11:52:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mx1u8c</id><link>http://www.starpulse.com/Television/Survivor/#comment-459684795</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-08-15</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
