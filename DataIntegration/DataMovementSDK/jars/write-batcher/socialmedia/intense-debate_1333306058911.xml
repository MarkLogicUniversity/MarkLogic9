It doesn't happen to Championship teams, particularly when there are only 14 games left in the season.
Their weakness now is the same weakness they had at the start of the season - no consistent outside shooting, which would prevent teams from packing the paint and doubling up on Milsap and Jefferson. Yes, they are exceeding expectations but this is not the year for the Jazz to make a solid run in the playoffs. Too much youth, inexpereience and a lack of outside shooting.
They would be better Off obtaining the draft choice they are about to lose.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67t4th</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6rx1</id></website><link>http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/jazz/53827703-87/kings-jazz-fredette-game.html.csp</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T00:20:30+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:04:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwi3p8</id><link>http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/jazz/53827703-87/kings-jazz-fredette-game.html.csp#comment-481813670</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/l7r2</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
