General Patton kept the Nazis in charge of the power stations, water pumping stations, the rail roads, until he had trained people to replace them.

I don't think much of GOP planning...We are going to be paying for GWBush's high gas prices for decades..</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z72pe</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/politics/oil-subsidies/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:34:09+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T21:49:34+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw4b9o</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/politics/oil-subsidies/index.html#comment-481239460</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a58ku</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
