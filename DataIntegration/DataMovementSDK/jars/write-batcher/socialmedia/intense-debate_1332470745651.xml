Clearly we get Burnt out by trying to do too many things at once. AND...most of the work that people do is not work that truly makes a difference. Its not only the quantity of work, but what impact people are asked to make. Those who work primarily on short term, reactive kinds of issues Burn out more than those who work on things they help them feel they make a difference. Crossing things Off the to do list feels good, but not satisfying if it doesn't take the organization or humanity to a higher level.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6cxuy4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mft1</id></website><link>http://blogs.hbr.org/schwartz/2012/03/the-magic-of-doing-one-thing-a.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-14T12:58:30+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T02:06:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi6453</id><link>http://blogs.hbr.org/schwartz/2012/03/the-magic-of-doing-one-thing-a.html#comment-474141777</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-14</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
