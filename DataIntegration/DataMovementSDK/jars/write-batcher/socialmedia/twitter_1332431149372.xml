I did not ask for it and certainly do not want it.Â  I find your comments very Cold and harsh. I am in pain almost every day. As with Lupus Fibromyalgia is NEVER going away, unless they find a cure.Â  Our syndrome is real and those of us with Fibro will have to live with it for the rest of our lives.Â You would not want someone to tell you your disease is not real or that "It is mass hysteria, secondary Gain from the "sickÂ role".Â  I am sorry for your illness and I hope your illness will open your heart and your feelings toÂ be more compasionate to others who are suffering even though there illness may not be terminal. We do suffer every day,Â we are human toÂ and do not deserve to be talked about by you are any one else.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ysktac</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/oys5</id></website><link>http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory-written-by-christine-miserandino/</link><postedTime>2012-03-05T14:22:33+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T15:45:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi2j6e</id><link>http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory-written-by-christine-miserandino/#comment-473687070</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-05</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
