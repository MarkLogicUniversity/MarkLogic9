They wouldn't bring him all bloody to the station like that, and most likely let him wipe Off his face (cause they don't like when you Bleed all up in the car, or around them) so closer footage would be the only way to tell since with this footage you wouldn't be able to make that shit out. Don't be a loser follower that can't see the obvious: This footage is pointless.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hwbrg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/u6cr</id></website><link>http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhsw6ZY9XXei0yVx57</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T01:00:05+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:17:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3v3bw</id><link>http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhsw6ZY9XXei0yVx57#comment-479480650</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z6n19</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
