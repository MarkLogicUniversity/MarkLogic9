Bush,.  the elder, has endorsed Romney before and why he has felt the need to repeat that endorsement makes me think that Romney is in trouble.  His son Jeb, has also endorsed Romney, perhaps he is wanting the V.P. Spot, but George W. Bush has not endorsed anyone so far. Maybe the Dad and Jeb think there will be a brokered convention, and that would be a danger to Romney because he has a lot of people who doubt his conservatism.  The Pledged delegates are released to vote for whomever they want. Votes taken until enough have decided on one candidate as I understand it.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zoqib</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rlyt</id></website><link>http://visiontoamerica.org/8966/bush-sings-know-when-to-fold-em-to-romney-rivals/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:50:44+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T14:24:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwyanb</id><link>http://visiontoamerica.org/8966/bush-sings-know-when-to-fold-em-to-romney-rivals/#comment-480792118</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/m38ma</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
