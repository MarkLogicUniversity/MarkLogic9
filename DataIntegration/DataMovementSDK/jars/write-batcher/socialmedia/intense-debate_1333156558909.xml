Jackson has potential and needs to work in more walks, less K's. You put Boesch behind Cabrera, Fielder, Young combo to help clean up... Boesch is a power hitter, Dirks will hit a better average. Avila will most likely not hit like he did last year. He should be at the bottom of the order at 9. PutÂ Santiago and Peralta at 7/8. Raburn is starting to take a dive in his hitting. He will have his moments, but he is not an every day starter. Kelly will be exciting to watch this season. I would like to see Worth continue his tear on the field as well. 

Tigers are getting too top heavy. We need a little more speed mixed in. I am hoping to see Berry in the near future as well as another young catcherÂ to help back-up Avila. I realize Martinez will be back next year, but he can't handle too many games behind the plate. He is pretty much DH duty. I like Santiago as our best choice for 2nd right now, but I would like to see a little more speed in this Spot someday. Perhaps we should start working Worth a little more at 2nd for the time being. I like the idea of Worth as Santiago's back-up over some other players (won't speak their names).</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z9hu0</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lz6q</id></website><link>http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27740592%26vkey=news_det%26c_id=det</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:38:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:33:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mweicu</id><link>http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120329%26content_id=27740592%26vkey=news_det%26c_id=det#comment-480689123</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/go3u8</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
