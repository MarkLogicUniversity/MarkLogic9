The "accidental" release of Martins suspension for possession of an empty bag of marijuana by the police department are highly suspicious.  I would be surprised if the police department actually "finds" the guilty officer who "leaked" the information to the press ...and fires him (as they have Pledged to do)
The police report that Martin was badly Bleeding a beaten with a broken nose also stands in stark contrast to apparently healthy Zimmerman caught on police station footage.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zaa3b</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/28/police-video-trayvon-martins-killer-smoking-gun-lawyer-says/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T03:38:16+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:05:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3qu3i</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/28/police-video-trayvon-martins-killer-smoking-gun-lawyer-says/#comment-479608050</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8ukj9</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
