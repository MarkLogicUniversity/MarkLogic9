Plus, throughout season 3, the writers are making audiences guess what the heck is she thinking.Â 

the house and her Burning desire to snatch it up the market is pathetic. If not for the sake of moving on with HER life, at the very least, how is it practical? kids going Off to college soon, she'll be alone in that big house, the maintenance, so much further from work and school. Bad idea.Â 

Didn't the writers promise something like her taking risk and "brand new Alicia", judging from the past few episode, we're well heading back to season 1. What's worst, a reconciliation btw Peter and Alicia seems likely, I mean why take a step forward then two backwards????Â 

And of course, she was angry with Peter and kalinda for lying to her last season. She's having problem talking to kalinda for most of this season but is more than friendly with Peter. WTF.
