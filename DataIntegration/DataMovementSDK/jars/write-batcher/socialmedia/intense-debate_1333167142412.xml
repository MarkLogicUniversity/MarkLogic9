Trainers as a whole use the drug cause they can. Does it enhance performance yes. Does it enhance performance in all horses NO. Â Lasix is aÂ diureticÂ it drains water from the horses systems. For all you people who have any idea about it. The way it enhances performance is by thickening the blood. A similar effect is called Blood doping which removes plasma from the blood and then the red blood cells are reintroduced to the system giving you a big advantage.Â 

In order to get your horse on lasix he has to have shown signs of Bleeding in the lungs. How do you get your horse on lasix in most states Â you slip your vet an extra hundred and Â he will see all kinds of blood in the horses lungs.Â 

This is a drug that is over used. Â Is it neccesary on race day no.Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zvyo4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xz0p</id></website><link>http://www.paulickreport.com/news/ray-s-paddock/irwin-race-day-medication-ban-all-about-perception/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:29:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:11:16+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3xkox</id><link>http://www.paulickreport.com/news/ray-s-paddock/irwin-race-day-medication-ban-all-about-perception/#comment-479711541</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
