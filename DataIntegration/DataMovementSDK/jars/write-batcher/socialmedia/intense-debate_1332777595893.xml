Why should the British airlines listen when all it would take to kill this round of empty threats is for the British Prime minister to write another letter prompting the aviation minister and her coward boss, the president, to set up a patronizing "panelâ€&#157; who would exonerate BA and Virgin? I said the minister of aviation is merely making noise; I said so simply on groundsÂ of what happened not too long ago. A federal aviation regulatory agency levied fines on BA and Virgin for racketeering and conspiracy to racketeer and then another federal government appointed "panel"Â (note I said panel in quotes because the panelists composed of folks I suppose are still strung out on overdose of colonial sedative probably kicked into high gear when the airlines probably gave out a few complimentary tickets) sold outÂ flat out. 
Â 
This report says the airlines were given 30 days to make amends after which they would be  from operating in Nigeria. Havenâ€™t we heard this too many â€œcrying wolfâ€&#157; times, often without any change to the status quo. I certainly could guess the airlinesâ€™ private reaction to this round of empty threats...Â one of the bossesÂ highly likely said "relax folks, haven't we seen this sort of grandstanding that never amount to anything too many times; Iâ€™d consider it the equivalent of my 5-year old throwing candy tantrums; throw in a couple candies â€“ rather complimentary tickets - and it would just blow over.â€&#157;Â 
Â 
Personally I do not consider the aviation minister and her sell out accomplices competent any more simply because they failed woefully in the past and allowed BA and Virgin to get  the hook when BA in particular paid so much to settle similar antitrust case in United States. If anything the aviation minister should admonish Nigerians to continue to shell out bigger bucks to BA and Virgin than flyers of both airlines do anywhere elseÂ in the world (per kilometer flown). The point is thatâ€™s how itâ€™s been for decades and that past and future Nigeria government appointed panels and officials would do what they Always did; work in the interests of foreign airlines. British airlines know Nigerians wellâ€¦ when the Heat comes all they need do is give out a bunch of complimentary tickets to bribe and kola crazy Nigerian officials and that would be the end of the that round of rhetoric. The aviation minister is just campaigning for a handful of complimentary tickets!
