$3.65 a gallon, nearing $6 in some parts of the country, and Poised to head
even higher, Americaâ€™s families are wondering when the Bleeding at the pump
will stop. But for Secretary of Energy Stephen Chu, those steep prices arenâ€™t
even a concern. In fact, he says his goal is not to get the price of gasoline
to go down.
Chu delivered those stunning remarks in testimony before Congress. When Rep.
Alan Nunnelee (R-Miss.) asked Chu whether itâ€™s his â€œoverall goal to get our
priceâ€&#157; of gasoline lower, Chu said, â€œNo, the overall goal is to decrease our
dependency on oil, to build and strengthen our economy.â€&#157; As shocking as his
remarks are, they shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise. Chu has a long record of
advocating for higher gas prices. In 2008, he stated, â€œSomehow we have to
figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.â€&#157; </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67vy2g</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/barack-obama/2012/03/30/president-obama-shuts-down-offshore-oil-drilling-5-years</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T23:02:33+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T05:57:47+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwf3or</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/barack-obama/2012/03/30/president-obama-shuts-down-offshore-oil-drilling-5-years#comment-481580363</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/mfh3b</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
