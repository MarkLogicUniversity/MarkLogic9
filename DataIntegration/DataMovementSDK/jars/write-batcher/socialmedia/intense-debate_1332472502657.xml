Zimmerman was known as a man who would call 911 repeatedly on minor things, and he was a noted racist. This murder screams "racially motivated". As a watch Captain, even as a "regular" citizen, he had no duty to , other than to either protect himself, or a third party. And ONLY if the situation warranted deadly force. This kid, armed with nothing more dealy than a bag of Skittles, is the true victim. While I can see that making an arrest on the Spot could be put  (a premature arrest could have clouded or even defeated any chance of a later prosecution), the overall investigation should be over with swiftly. The so-called "Stand Your Ground" Law, was put in place as a protection from the inevitable civil litigation that would follow if a true victim was faced with a deadly force situation. IT DOES NOT PROMOTE VIGILANTE JUSTICE. IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU AUTHORITY TO ACT. Zimmerman, Florida has a death penalty. May God have mercy on your soul. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6y9uhd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmw</id></website><link>http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/03/22/3828915/fla-police-chief-steps-down-temporarily.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:58:38+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T02:48:28+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi6wf7</id><link>http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/03/22/3828915/fla-police-chief-steps-down-temporarily.html#comment-474163251</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8bxvx</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
