After receiving his Ph.D. degree in Ecosystem Dynamics from the Australian National University in 1992, he worked as a consultant until moving to the San Diego Supercomputer Center at University of California San Diego in 1997. There he continued his work developing computational and data intensive methods of ecological niche modelling using museum collections data.

â€œThe increase in temperature due to the greenhouse effect has a maximum. At this maximum, additional greenhouse gas absorbers do not increase the temperature to the limits detectable in this setup.â€&#157;

â€œTwo claims made in the IPCC Chapter 3 Section 3.4 p40 of WG1 are obviously false.â€&#157;

and

Russia - Dr. Oleg Sorochtin of the Institute of Oceanology at the Russian Academy of Sciences has authored more than 300 studies, nine books, and a 2006 paper titled "The Evolution and the Prediction of Global Climate Changes on Earth." . (Note: Name also sometimes translated to spell Sorokhtin) 

"Even if the concentration of greenhouse gases double, man would not perceive the temperature impact"

and

New Zealand - Professor Geoffrey G. Duffy, in the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering of the University of Auckland,

"Even doubling or tripling the amount of carbon dioxide will virtually have little impact, as water vapour and water condensed on particles as clouds dominate the worldwide scene and Always will.".

and 

Hungary - Dr. Miklos Zagoni (physicist and environmental researcher) Once Hungaryâ€™s most outspoken supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, reversed his view and is now a skeptic.

â€œTo put it in a language that IPCC will understand: Extra CO2 does not result in extra 'radiative forcing' in the final account, as the energy constraint rules it back to its equilibrium value. Nature's regulatory instrument is water vapor: more carbon dioxide leads to less moisture in the air, keeping the overall GHG content in accord with the necessary balance conditions. So, contrary to the common wisdom, there is no positive H2O-temperature feedback on global scale: in Earth-type atmospheres uncontrolled runaway warming is not possible.â€&#157;

â€œCO2 is a rather harmless greenhouse gas.â€&#157;

â€œCO2 in air has been branded as the culprit for causing the green house effect, causing global warming. However, regularly omitted is another important green house gas also present in air and in much higher concentration. It is water vapor. In the air, it absorbs infrared radiation (Heat) more strongly than CO2. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is considerably lower than that of water vapor; it is just a few percent. Consequently, doubling the CO2 concentration would not significantly increase the combined absorption of the two greenhouse gases of water vapor and CO2.â€&#157;
