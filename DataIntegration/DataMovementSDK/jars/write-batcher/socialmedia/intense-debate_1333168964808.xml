Perhaps my favorite use of our big oak is that is holds our son's swing.  I will Always remember sitting under the tree and pushing him. Our trees have definitely given us some wonderful memories in addition to adding curb appeal and some financial savings.
I also have to say that I love the idea of giving a tree as a housewarming gift.  In addition, I think it serves as a beautiful baby gift.  How special to watch them both grow!
Thanks for the article!
