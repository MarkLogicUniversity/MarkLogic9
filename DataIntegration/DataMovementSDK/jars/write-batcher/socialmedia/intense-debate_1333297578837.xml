1000s BCE: kingdom of Israel, sanctioned by the egyptians, which extended well into what is now Syria
600s BCE: Babylonian empire conquered the entire middle east,  to the arabian sea. jews are treated badly.
300s BCE: Persian empire conquers even more. jews are treated terribly.
50 BCE: Macedonians
0: Roman empire. Jews live peacefully, then later expelled from the area. (Cough Cough. racism?)

700s CE: Sassanid empire
800s CE: Caliphate
1100s CE: Seljuk empire
1180s CE: Crusaders
1200s CE: Saladin

1900s CE: British Mandate
1948: Israel re-established in a smaller area than was previously, after the area that is now Jordan was broken Off to become, well, Jordan
