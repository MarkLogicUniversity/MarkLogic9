One who is open and encouraging towards healthful living.  She changed my synthroid to armour thyroid which is natural and has encouraged me to take an iodine supplement. I am very encouraged by the results.  She also noticed low iron.  Things the other doctor has not mentioned in the 10 yrs I have gone there.  Hang in there.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zprif</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rr4n</id></website><link>http://www.beyonddiet.com/Members/Profiles/Details/audreykornelson</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:36:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:42:34+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwm2e5</id><link>http://www.beyonddiet.com/Members/Profiles/Details/audreykornelson#comment-480696988</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hdii2</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
