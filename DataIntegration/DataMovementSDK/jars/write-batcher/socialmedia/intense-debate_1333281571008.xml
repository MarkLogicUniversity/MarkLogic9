Mention the word "global tax" in a third world country, and what that means to them is that the U.S. taxpayers are going to get gouged in order to send them MORE money than they already do.Â  How about this: bann all foreign aid, other than for disaster assistance, and let these foreign countries raise their own tax revenues.


Any country that has had less than 15% of its land mass under water, or devastated by earthquake, fire, etc. in the last five years should not be getting any assistance from the U.S.

Some of the countries that are addicted to U.S. funding, like Israel, may have to be weaned Off, but for the most part, these third world countries that are taking American jobs, while American subsidies go into the hands of their dictators, can go Cold turkey. The people aren't actually getting any of the money anyway, and who cares a dictator has withdrawal symptoms from lack of U.S. taxpayer funding. Notice I didn't say "foreign" dictator. There are others.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67lsei</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/o2bq</id></website><link>http://patriotupdate.com/20587/biden-we-want-to-create-a-global-minimum-tax</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:10:37+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:10:51+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwxwcn</id><link>http://patriotupdate.com/20587/biden-we-want-to-create-a-global-minimum-tax#comment-481394144</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
