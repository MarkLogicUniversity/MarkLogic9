Telling people that they are sinners and must repent to God for forgiveness by accepting His son, Jesus or else they'll Burn in the lake of fire isn't going to get you a piece of cake.  It means rejection by the world at large and persecution by the authorities.  We love our neighbors, we can't stop ringing the alarm bell now, we're SO close! This Pastor's arrest is a badge of honor, not disgrace.  Hallelujah brother!  Shame on the authorities and whomever Dialed 9-1-1.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zh26v</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/29/taking-liberties-arrested-for-reading-bible/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:06:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T06:52:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m30qk3</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/29/taking-liberties-arrested-for-reading-bible/#comment-480349293</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rnj7x</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
