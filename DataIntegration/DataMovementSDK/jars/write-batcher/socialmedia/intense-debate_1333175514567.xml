What a wild ride!  And I think David did well at  for someone who hasn't Acted before, especially since he had to react to lines he didn't understand real-time. There were some awkward Spots but he did great with the romantic, crying, and action scenes. So many great scenes!!  Plus David's voice singing the themes.  We are anxiously awaiting release of subtitled DVDs from TV5. BTW David started a 2-year mission for his church two days ago Mar 28 2012. His twitter is DavidArchie and either David (if allowed) or his manager Kari will post any messages from David for the fans.  His official website and many fansites including fansofdavid will remain open. His Philippines album Forevermore has been released, music video will be released tomorrow, and he recorded another classic or inspirational album in the US before he left, working up to the last day on that. #DA2014 I'll Be Here</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z6m1b</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q150</id></website><link>http://entertainment.inquirer.net/34887/hoping-against-hope</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T11:44:05+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T15:52:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw60fx</id><link>http://entertainment.inquirer.net/34887/hoping-against-hope#comment-480883017</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dm6x</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
