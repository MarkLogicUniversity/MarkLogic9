A FoxNews article today begins with this provocative title:


Taking Liberties: Arrested for reading the Bible?


The title and the article give the intentional impression that Christian Fundamentalist Mark Mackey was arrested for simply reading the Christian bible. 


As if he was dragged from his home and thrown into prison for reading a religious book. 


As you might guess, thereâ€™s a bit more to it than that, for example Mackey wasnâ€™t quietly reading the bible to himself at home, he was engaged in the obnoxious asshatery of â€œwitnessingâ€&#157; to folks waiting in line in front of a California State DMV office. He was asked by both security and police to cease and desist, he refused and continued to annoy the hell out of people who had the choice of either listening to his unsolicited proselytizing or giving up their position in line (I suppose they also had the choice of punching him in the mouth repeatedly, which would have been my first impulse, but I digress).Â  


Despite Foxâ€™s deliberately misleading and alarmist headline, Mackey was not arrested for â€œreading the bible,â€&#157; he was arrested for being an irritating asshole.


The editors at FoxNews know this, of course, thatâ€™s why they used the yellow journalism technique of casting the title of the article as a question.Â  Arrested for being a Christian? Well, what do you think, poor persecuted Christians? Wink, wink. One has to wonder how the folks at Fox would have written this story if it had been a brown skinned man in a turban Shouting Suras from the Quran. 


However, be that as it may, a rather large number of the faithful regard this arrest as just one more example of the ongoing bigotry against Christians in America, on par with being Burned at the stake or thrown to the lions in the Coliseum. Commenters on Fox Nation lament this supposed â€œwar on Christiansâ€&#157; and rage against the abuse and bigotry that poor persecuted followers of Jesus have to endure every day as a repressed and harassed minority in America. You can read the story in much more detail for yourself, itâ€™s been widely repeated on numerous Christian conservative websites and a video of the incident is, of course, on YouTube. With a little GoogleFu, You should have no trouble finding numerous examples.


Now, hereâ€™s what I find interesting, if you read the various articles on those same sites, articles about this incident and the recent killing of a young black man in Sanford, Florida, and if you read the articles and comments under various faith blogs and the mainstream media reports of the aforementioned shooting youâ€™ll notice a few things:


1. There is no racism in America anymore, because a black man is president, Q.E.D. However, despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of American presidents have been openly Christian, including the current one, there is an ongoing American bias against Christians. 
2. A white man cannot harbor racist prejudice against people of color if his mother is Hispanic.Â  However, a president whose mother was white and father was black clearly hates white people. 



3. A man who pursues another man lawfully minding his own business on a public street and then provokes a confrontation resulting in death, is not guilty of either murder nor manslaughter, but is, in fact, a patriot defending the constitutional freedoms of all Americans. However, an American citizen lawfully minding his own business on a public street who is confronted by an armed man has no right to either stand his ground, defend himself, or meet force with like force.Â  He is, by simple nature of his appearance, a thug who deserves what he gets.



4. Conservatives, gun owners, police, neighborhood watchers, and Christians should not be judged by a few extremists in their ranks.Â  However, all black teenage males wearing hoodies may, in point of fact, be labeled thugs and criminals until proven otherwise. 


I suppose this form of doublethink isnâ€™t particularly surprising, coming as it does from a group of people who seem to think that a country steeped in Christian tradition up to and including national icons, official mottos, symbols, phrases, traditions, oaths, federal holidays and composed of an overwhelming majority of Christians who have unashamedly declared this a Christian nation at the exclusion of other beliefs, and whose government, military, and law enforcement agencies are in fact composed almost entirely of Christians, is engaged in a war on Christians. 


Heh.


Â 
A number of you wrote to ask my opinion of the Trayvon Martin shooting, or to ask why I had not already posted something â€“ do I not care?
Of course I care.
