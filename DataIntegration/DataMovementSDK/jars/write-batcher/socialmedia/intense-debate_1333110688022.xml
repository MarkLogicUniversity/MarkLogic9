Be very wary of almonds.  Once researchers discovered that they had serious anti-cancer agents the FDA Banned them. How?  By making producers pasteurize them (Heat destroys the good parts) or gassing them with the known carcinogen - propylene oxide.  Why?  I know and if you follow the money you'll know as well.

It gets better.  Per the FDA, after treatment they can still be sold as "raw."  The only true raw almonds that can be sold can only be marketed on farm property where they were grown. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6htto5</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/03/28/6-forbidden-foods-can-eat/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T16:20:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:29:05+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3pq10</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/03/28/6-forbidden-foods-can-eat/#comment-480069107</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/es84n</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
