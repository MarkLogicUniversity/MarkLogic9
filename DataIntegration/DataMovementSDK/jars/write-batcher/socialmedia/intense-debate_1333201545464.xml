The neighborhood groups of homeowners could be charged a certain fee, like CCR's and a viable clinic could be maintained.  Docs could treat non-life threatening things like cut fingers and people with bad Cold symptoms to name a few.  When the going gets too rough, 911 could transport to hospital.  Just a thought from a humble person tired of this problem Always rearing its ugly head and nothing over the years has been done about it...fix it and we all will be healed! </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67dex7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t33k</id></website><link>http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/2012/03/30/viewer-comment-to-last-nights-on-the-record-at-10pm/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:26:09+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:25:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwzhdy</id><link>http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/2012/03/30/viewer-comment-to-last-nights-on-the-record-at-10pm/#comment-481040505</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c1nk4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
