How many more days until Jen totally loses her shit because she's not sleeping at night because the kids are awake since they are being forced to sleep in the car all day?

I predict by day 4 she will be so tired she won't know what to do with herself.  

I predict at least 1 ER/urgent care visit by at least one child.

I predict a hospital stay for Jen near the end of this trip or as soon as she gets home.  Mama's gonna need a little vacay to recover from this, checking into the hospital will be the only way.

I predict at least 2 car emergencies (no gas, keys locked up, engine exploding,  etc.....)

I predict many photos posted by sheeple showing what a state of utter mess Jen looks when she arrives and does photoshoots.

I predict the Weight loss will stop and turn into weight Gain. 


What else will we see on this trip?  Post predictions folks and we'll see how it all turns out in a couple weeks.
