Sorry for the long post but here it goes.
As a former tester for one of the biggest
publishers around I can tell you all that this article is 100% accurate. I was
a permanent employee within the company that is
until they laid us  to outsource our work to Canada. The article is accurate,
as a tester you are the bottom of the barrel, the lowest of the low and are
treated as such. The funny thing is with this is that as a tester you are the
backbone of the project. Without testers games would never be made. Developers
and publishers can make the games but without testing the games would ship with
all kinds of issues. 


Here are the plus sides to working as a tester (just so you
all donâ€™t think I am just trashing the job):


1.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Free food on the weekends and during over time.


2.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Free copies of any game you worked on.


3.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Substantial discount on any game the company
makes (we paid $10-15 for x360 and PS3,$ 5-10 for PC).


4.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
You get to work with people like you (same love
for video games) who help to pass the time and make the work fun.


5.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Guaranteed overtime. I should note this is guaranteed
to an extent. If your team does the best job possible (finds the majority of
the bugs before crunch time) your overtime could be very short or you could have none at all.


6.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Snacks one day out of the week (maybe more if
your project lead spends their own money for their team). 


7.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
At our company (and anyone who worked at this
place will know it from this) we had a mystery box filled with prizes forÂ testers.
We would award testers for things that stood out to us during the course of the
project (like finding the most bugs or highest K/D ratio on one of our mp
battles). The testers would be allowed to grab an item from our mystery box or
pick a mystery item that we picked out for them.


8.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Little to no dress code. Testing is a very laid
back environmentâ€¦as long as you wear clothes and take a showerÂ  every few days your good. Â Go dressed in your PJâ€™s and donâ€™t shower for a
week and youâ€™re probably going to be sent home (itâ€™s funny but it happenedâ€¦more
than once).


Now the bad:


1.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The pay sucks $10 starting pay ($15 for OT). Thatâ€™s
not a lot of money for the amount of work you do. But when your desperate for a job its gods gift.


2.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Tedious, repetitive, boring work. Like the
article said running through the same level over and over again for 8+ hours a
day for 6 months to a year is not fun. I donâ€™t care how much you like a game series you
will learn to hate it by the end of a project.


3.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Little to no respect. As a tester you are dirtâ€¦no
dirt gets some respect. You are the crap at the bottom of your shoe. Developers
hate you (to an extent) because you point out their mistakes (when working as a
tester for the production side). If you work at the developer side your
actually treated better because you areâ€&#157; helping them make the game betterâ€&#157;.
Production will hate you because you are holding up the game from being
released by finding all the issues. This becomes even more obvious during
crunch time. God forbid you find a game breaking bug during crunch because prod
and devs will hate you for not finding it sooner and causing them to dip
further into the budget for ot or pointing out how they screwed the title up
from one build to another (your fellow testers may love you because you just
single handedly extended OT another day or two). You are scum and are reminded
of it on a regular basis.


4.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
You are guaranteed
to get laid  at the end of a project. Bug count matters but there is no bug
count high enough to save you from the chopping block if there is no title for
you to work on. Even as a permanent employee layoffs can happen at any time
(typically around the time the company is releasing their quarterly earnings or if a game fails horribly).


5.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
It is very political and who you know matters
just as much as bug count. This can be said for any job. I saw many people suck
up to Sr. Testers, Project leads, and up just to try and Ensure their positions
or a call back when another project started. Keep your friends close and your
enemies closer never held truer than on the testing floor. You might as well be
back in high school with all the cliques on the testing floor.


6.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Little to no cross training. There isnâ€™t too
much to testing other than find an issue, repeat it, repeat it again, repeat it
once more and video tape it, and lastly report it. But there are other
departments that you could learn about to make you a more effective tester (such
as the technical requirements group, Burn lab, Net lab, etc), unfortunately you
will never train in these departments because there is never any time.


7.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Your resources are good but not as good as they
are in other departments. The testers at the development level definitely have
better equipment and better resources at their disposal.


8.Â Â Â Â Â Â 
If you fall asleep you can be fired on the Spot.
It has happened.






There is defiantly more but those were typically the biggest
gripes and perks. 


I would also like to note that although the testers had â€œchevronaldsâ€&#157;
to eat there were other places around like Togoâ€™s, subway, the habit, chipotle,
and many other places they could have gone to eat with in driving and walking
distance. 


AS far as not getting paid for workâ€¦that is rare and if it
does happen it is 100% illegal. Those testers should know better and should
have called the EDD.


Your opinions countâ€¦to you and your fellow testers. I can
100% say that every tester warned this company about a certain flaw with their
planned release of a title (5 of them to be precise) but the company saw dollar
signs and ignored all the concerns the testers brought up. That game is now in
limbo (more than likely canceled).


If you want to make it in the gaming world move up from
testing as fast as you can or get into production (Admin not testing). 


Itâ€™s not like grandmas boysâ€¦ well not 100% (80% of the
people that you work with will be on something). You donâ€™t have 4 guys testing
one game and you donâ€™t submit fancy reports. Typically there are 15-100+ testers
working on a title (thatâ€™s just on the production side, the developers will
have another 50 or more) and reports are sent one issue at a time via an online system.


When you are interviewed you are asked if you can work 40
hours or more. If you say you can do 40 but little to no over time you can kiss
youre chance at a job good bye. If you say yes and then for whatever reason cannot
do the overtime when needed consider yourself fired or at the very least you wont get a call back for the next project.
