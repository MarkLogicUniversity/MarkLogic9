Russia on the other hand says one thing but there is very little that can be done to verify what they say or agree to. China, France, U.K, India, Pakistan and N. Korea also have nuclear weapons. Israel is suspected of having them and Iran and Syria are suspected of having a developement program in effect. On top of that, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine andÂ South Africa were known to previouslyÂ have them and who can say they still don't? Additionally, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Turkey share nuclear weapons under the NATO umbrella.Â I, and I'm sure most othersÂ that grew up in the 40's &amp; 50's, and most who served in the military during the 60's &amp; 70's, would love to have a perfect world with "safe" nuclear power plants and noÂ nuclear, biological, chemical or other weapons of mass destruction. Face it, dead is dead no matter how you get killed. IÂ (without swearing) personallyÂ do not trust the current administration to handle this as President Obama has proven that he will say one thing and do another. His -mike comment shows that he will do or say anything to get re-elected and it would not surprise me if once he does, he tries to show everyone how serious he is by destroyingÂ US weapons hoping others follow suit. Like Mr. Obama, I do not believe a word that comes out of countries like N Korea or Iran's mouth. Likewise with Israel. Anyone that would think they are going to give up their biggest defensive weapon is crazy, no matter what they say.Â Â  the "huge nuclear stockpiles" have consistently been reduced since the end of the Cold war (at least by America).
