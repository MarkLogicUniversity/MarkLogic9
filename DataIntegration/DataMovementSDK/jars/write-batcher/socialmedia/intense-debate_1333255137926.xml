Like &amp;quot;moo&amp;#039;ing,&amp;quot; it&amp;#039; doesn&amp;#039;t work as wordplay in the context &amp;amp; just distracts from the (lackof?) facts. As did comparing yoga as a product to Coca Cola which you identify as a diabetes causer. This image and connection you chose, the most vivid in your 800 words, loudly challenges on a gut level your explicit argument that  the health benefits of yoga account for it&amp;#039;s business success. Was this self-subversion intentional? And what are the Cold waters of yoga? When you say &amp;quot;There has been a lot of foul play against YAMA,&amp;quot; do you really mean there have been unfair Acts against YAMA, or do you mean there has been criticism you think is unfair? If so, could you give examples &amp;amp; refute, or else why bother to bring it up, if you have nothing specific to add that hasn&amp;#039;t been said by Sadie in her eloguent comments in past articles?
