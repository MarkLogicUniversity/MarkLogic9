I am now 23 and have been doing research for over a year on Xanax, and while I am thankful for the drug I am ready to cut it . I have realized most notably it makes me tired, yes school has been much less of a worry and while I graduate in May and am thankful for Xanax helping me get through school I want to be free of it come May. I am a evangelical christian and decided I don't want drugs running my life but Christ, just trying to give everything to him. I am a motivated person so it was not hard for me to go Off Xanax... it's been two days and while I am happy I am not taking the drug I do notice a cloudiness to my days a slowness, and every once in a while Dizziness. I understand it's part of the withdrawal process, but I am happy to know I am not the only one dealing with this. I would also like to let you all know that this is beatable, as it seems many of you are taking lower doses than me and suffering for harsher withdrawals, but I KNOW I will beat it so know that YOU can too! Have faith!

"He said to me," 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.' "Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christâ€™s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong. - 2nd Corinthians 12:9-10</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/goty2d</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/qmjk</id></website><link>http://www.choosehelp.com/detox/xanax-withdrawal-symptoms-how-to-get-off-xanax.html</link><postedTime>2011-07-05T15:25:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-14T00:43:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m1u3b2</id><link>http://www.choosehelp.com/detox/xanax-withdrawal-symptoms-how-to-get-off-xanax.html#comment-464690664</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-07-05</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
