They need to go after the Black Panthers who put a Bounty on
Zimmerman’s head. It did not say dead or alive but read between the lines.  Spike Lee is another agitator who gave out

The address was wrong and the elderly couple had to flee for their lives
as they where threatened with death and having their house Burned down.  Oh yes and the couple just happened to be
white.
