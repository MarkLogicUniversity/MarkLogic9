I&amp;#039;d also love to see these guys have their bank accounts frozen and assets stripped by the revenue and sent to prison like the criminals that they are, but i doubt that will happen either, the reason being that all of politicians in this country are the same and theres no way they are gonna light a fire on something that could Burn them too in the future. 
 
Having said that if enda did manage to pull this Off he might just regain a little of the respect that he has lost over the past year from the electorate. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:226676:127418892</id><idPostId>127418892</idPostId><idBlogId>226676</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:226676</id><idBlogId>226676</idBlogId><link>http://www.breakingnews.ie</link><displayName>BreakingNews.ie</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/government-to-consider-withdrawing-pensions-from-corrupt-politicians-545014.html</link><displayName>Government to consider withdrawing pensions from corrupt politicians | BreakingNews.ie</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:42:58.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:226676:127418892:324924613</id><link>http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/government-to-consider-withdrawing-pensions-from-corrupt-politicians-545014.html#IDComment324924613</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:42:58.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Government to consider withdrawing pensions from corrupt politicians | BreakingNews.ie by Guest 4</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link/><idEmailMd5>2c8d23604b1b0df8682a484429617de6</idEmailMd5><displayName>Guest 4</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>Guest 4 commented on &lt;a href="http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/government-to-consider-withdrawing-pensions-from-corrupt-politicians-545014.html"&gt;Government to consider withdrawing pensions from corrupt politicians | BreakingNews.ie&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
