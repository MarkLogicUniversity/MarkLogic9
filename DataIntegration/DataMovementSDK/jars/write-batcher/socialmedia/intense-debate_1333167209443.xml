That is why those libs in congress, along with the pres, wants the fairness doctrine. But they had to back Off knowing that all radio stations that carry conservative talk show hosts are the bread and butter of these stations. Plus the fact, not too many people really listens to the libs on AM and FM radio, let alone on seriusxm. 
Rock on Rush, rock on.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zq6ih</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/rush-limbaugh/2012/03/29/rush-limbaugh-ratings-60-fluke-controversy</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T18:44:23+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T14:37:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwyrl3</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/rush-limbaugh/2012/03/29/rush-limbaugh-ratings-60-fluke-controversy#comment-480804801</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h9w0o</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
