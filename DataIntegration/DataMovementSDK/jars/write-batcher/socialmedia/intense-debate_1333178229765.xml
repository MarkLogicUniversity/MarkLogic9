I think if Gino had lived, he would have been the one to take Ole's place. Like Tully, the guy could draw Heat!!..Been following wrestling since the early 80's... I laugh at some of the comments that others put on here. One thing I would not do is argue relentlessly like some do on here(name calling etc.)....Lex Luger was still green when he took Ole's Spot. Gino was a polished product, who would have fit in like a glove. I actually visited Gino's grave earlier this year, since I now live in Houston, TX. So sad he died at 29, just as his career was about to take Off... I miss the old territories :(</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zum3o</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dhf8</id></website><link>http://www.ewrestlingnews.com/news/3909/videos-finkel-blanchard-speaks-out-dgusa-preview</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:37:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:10:48+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwrzyg</id><link>http://www.ewrestlingnews.com/news/3909/videos-finkel-blanchard-speaks-out-dgusa-preview#comment-480901865</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lbmt8</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
