However, the optimism you place on Labour to do anything about it is a very misguided optimism.

The system favours and serves the elite and Labour are a willing part of that very system and have been for a generation.  It is believed that to deviate from this invented neo-con consensus would be political suicide.  The press would not accept and it is perceived that people would be duped, and worringly I think many of them would.  

Labour will continue to play the role of enabling our economic structures with fluff around the edges.

Labour do not have the balls to Act as the people need anymore.

Nothing and no-one from within our current political system has the desire, or the courage to make any real changes.

We the people, through general strikes have to make it known we need a left-wing alternative and only then, largely in the name of political opportunism will anything change. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z1s8l</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mxv6</id></website><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/owen-jones-were-now-governed-by-the-political-wing-of-the-wealthy-7601024.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:07:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:19:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3pzgi</id><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/owen-jones-were-now-governed-by-the-political-wing-of-the-wealthy-7601024.html#comment-480061938</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hmsqn</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
