Once somebody has their Spot in the pecking order made abundantly clear (as Colton loved doing), they can't be asking back into the fold at a later date (unless they are either desperate or weak-willed). So Mike and Jay had no reason to give up a Spot inÂ the power alliance of Saleni to support the guys who were ready to pick them Off. Even if the same ends up being true of the women, they at least were able to build some relationships there that they can hope to count on. With the men, they had so little power and relationships that they voted to go to Tribal Council, just to avoid rocking the boat.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h0plv</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-beauty-in-a-merge,71440/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T02:19:39+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:28:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m310iw</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-beauty-in-a-merge,71440/#comment-479856778</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dn2oi</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
