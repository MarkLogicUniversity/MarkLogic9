1. American covert operatives are portrayed as brave, honorable, selfless, and dedicated to protecting the innocent (as opposed to the disillusioned skeptics of "Body of Lies" and the stone Cold assasins who either target civilians or end up as self loathers like the "Bourne" series)
2. Â the threat comes not from "deranged right wingers" or "corrupt capitalists", but from a fanatical foreign terrorist (though not jihadist) who cannot be negotiatied with
3. America is NOT TO BLAME for the terrorist Acts on any level
4. The generalÂ dihonesty of the media is directly addressedÂ 
5. The President (WHO AT THIS TIME IS OBAMA) refuses toÂ outright to dealÂ with the terrorist threatÂ and instead shuts down an entire agency charged with protecting the American people and and targets our brave covertÂ operatives as the terrorists for the sake of politics. His actions almost cost humanity its survival. HOW INTERESTING!Â Â Â Â Â Â 	

**** By the way, this film has made almost $700 million worldwide.
