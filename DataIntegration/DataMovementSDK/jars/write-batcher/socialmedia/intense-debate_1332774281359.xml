I am a senior citizen on limited income trying to hold on to my home that I worked all my life to own .I have old outdated electric baseboard Heat Heating my home . I can't afford the cost to update to Natural gas or even to take advantage of Government rebates on updating my Heating system to help lower my Electric consumption....       There are thousands of us in the same situation and some in even worst ........Citizens in the US pay less for Canadian electricity than Canadians.
