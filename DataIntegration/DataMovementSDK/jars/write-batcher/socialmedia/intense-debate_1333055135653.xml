requirements for new parishioners.
 
You must abstain from sex for an entire month."The couple agreed and, after two-and-a-half weeks,
returned to the church.
 
When the Pastor ushered them into his office, the wife was crying,and the husband obviously was very depressed.
 
"You are back so soon...Is there a problem?" the pastor inquired."We are terribly ashamed to admit that we did not manage to abstainfrom sex for the required month," the young man replied sadly.The pastor asked him what happened.
 
"Well, the first week was difficult; however, we managed to abstainthrough sheer will power. The second week was terrible , but withthe use of prayer, we managed to abstain. The third week, however,was unbearable.

When she bent over to pick it up, I noticed that she didn't havepanties on and I was overcome with lust and I had my way with her,right then and there," admitted the man, shamefacedly.
