We haven't seen that 2008/09 season kind of football yet from LFC .
But being 100 % commited to support LFC , had to say , that all these days we were playing direct football without any creative midfield and lacklustured finishing , upfront . And no need to mention recent defensive bizzares . 
I think if Dalglish starts playing attractive football instead of ruining his&amp;our mind searching for excuses , we will start getting result .
Leave the champions league Spot but it will be good for the team and things will start gelling together .Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r1y0r</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/y62v</id></website><link>http://www.espnstar.com/football/premier-league/news/detail/item776587/Dalglish-considering-tactical-rethink/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T05:01:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:48:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk9fqa</id><link>http://www.espnstar.com/football/premier-league/news/detail/item776587/Dalglish-considering-tactical-rethink/#comment-476577469</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
