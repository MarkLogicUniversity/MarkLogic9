If so, how can they know when they were not there?

As usual, we see with Liberals that they have a lynch mob mentality. Â They make decisions out of emotion and prejudice, rather than facts and objectivity.

First, most people thought the shooter was White, because they WANTED it to be a White man.

Then...

Most people assumed that the shooter was a Cold back stabbing killer who got   free, because they WANTED a White system to beÂ responsibleÂ for the "injustice."

This entire drama just demonstrates that what the "Hoodie people" want is a race war, but they are just too cowardly to just launch one out of their own will....because their wills are weak.

â€œTo exercise power costs effort and demands courage. That is why so many fail to assert rights to which they are perfectly entitled -- because a right is a kind of power but they are too lazy or too cowardly to exercise it. The virtues which cloak these faults are called patience and forbearance.â€&#157; - Nietzsche

I must say, IF this side of the story is true, then I am Glad that Trayvon is dead, and justice was served.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l2zjw</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gblz</id></website><link>http://www.newser.com/story/comments/142713/zimmerman-trayvon-martin-pummeled-me.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:39:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:35:41+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk94a6</id><link>http://www.newser.com/story/comments/142713/zimmerman-trayvon-martin-pummeled-me.html#comment-476567758</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zawm0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
