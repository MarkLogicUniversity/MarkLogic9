No, keeping track of what qualifies as anti-Semitism isÂ  no more exhausting than keeping track of what qualifies as racism or homophobia.Â  I'm pretty sure that you're against those, right?Â  And my point is not that Andrew Sullivan hates Israel, although based on what he wrote while he was at the Atlantic (and I must confess that I have not read him since he left), he does.Â  That's OK with me, by the way -- it's his right and yours.Â  The point Roy made, and which I seconded, is that in expressing his opinions, on Israel and otherwise, he has used language that is indicative of the anti-Jew equivalent of racism, which has been given, by unfortunate history, the name "anti-Semitism."Â Â  Just repeating "End the Occupation" over and over doesn't address the point.Â  Perhaps you have confused me with the government of Israel; I am powerless to end the Occupation, even though, as I've said, I also oppose it. Â  Or perhaps you mean that you are so sick of the Occupation that you no longer care about the motives of some of your fellow critics.Â  That would be a mistake on your part.Â  As my mother used to remind me, if you lie down with dogs, you'll wake up with fleas.Â  

As for what was wrong with Sullivan's "wings" comment, either you don't understand or don't want to understand.Â  Since I have no reason to think of you otherwise than charitably, I will assume the former (since the latter would be odious), and will give you a long quote from Wieseltier's article, which you have declined to read, that explains:

His [Sullivan's] assumption, in his outburst about â€œthe Goldfarb-Krauthammer wing,â€&#157; 
that every thought that a Jew thinks is a Jewish thought is an 
anti-Semitic assumption, and a rather classical one. Bigotry has Always 
made representatives of individuals, and discerned the voice of the 
group in the voice of every one of its members. Is everything that every
 gay man says a gay statement? I will give an example. On October 15, 
2001, when the ruins of the World Trade Center still smoldered, Sullivan
 published a piece in the Times of London called â€œA British View 
of the US Post-September 11.â€&#157; In this piece he accused Bill Clinton of 
â€œappeasement,â€&#157; and praised George W. Bush for assembling â€œthe ideal 
teamâ€&#157; for a â€œtaskâ€&#157; that â€œcannot be done by airpower alone,â€&#157; and had kind
 words for Americaâ€™s â€œworld hegemonyâ€&#157;â€“the politics changes, the Fever 
remains the sameâ€“and also included this unforgettable sentence: â€œThe 
decadent Left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead â€“ and may well 
mount what amounts to a fifth column.â€&#157; A fifth column! It is a genuinely
 sinister sentence.

I wish to emphasize two features of Sullivanâ€™s Â comment. The first is 
that it is an exercise in demonization: it divides the American people 
into good Americans and bad Americans. The second is that it is in no 
way an expression of Sullivanâ€™s homosexuality. It must never be said 
that when Sullivan lauded the bellicosity of Cheney and Rumsfeldâ€“which 
wing of American Christianity, by the way, shall we blame for them? â€“he 
exchanged the company of the good gays for the company of the bad gays. 
To say that would be homophobic. Here is what such homophobia would look
 like: Most American homosexuals, of course, retain a respect for 
art, and compassion for the other, and support for minorities. But the 
Sullivan-Shmullivan wing of American homosexualityâ€“that celebrates and 
believes in torture and war, and endorses the pulverization of Afghan 
villages with glee, and wants to attack any country where Al Qaeda may 
be foundâ€“is something else. Something much darker. Get it?
