The bottom line is that this team needs to see what these young guys have to offer and they are not going to be able to do so if they maintain the Ed Wade mentality of bringing in over-the-hill guys.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67mi4y</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gyfc</id></website><link>http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2012/03/astros-release-livan-hernandez.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:10:19+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:08:36+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwl12n</id><link>http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2012/03/astros-release-livan-hernandez.html#comment-480961172</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z7e8v</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
