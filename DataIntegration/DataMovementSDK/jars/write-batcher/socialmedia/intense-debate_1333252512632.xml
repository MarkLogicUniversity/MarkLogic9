Before he left MSNBC he was getting too vitriolic, and too angry, and was beginning to fulminate just a bit too much, descending into name-calling, and living for personal feuds.

I think this is a guy that needs an enemy, and his employers both at MSNBC and the new network that hardly anyone watches became that enemy. An eternal sense of injustice can make someone a powerful advocate, but it can also eat someone alive.Â 

Sorry, Keith, but I think you've Burnt yourself out. Good luck.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67zrpv</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/showbiz/current-tv-olbermann/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T21:17:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T00:21:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwxg4m</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/showbiz/current-tv-olbermann/index.html#comment-481357087</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hsqmk</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
