When I look at pictures of myself when I was 18 there is a big difference, but I can't see the differences from 18-19 and so on. I no longer have a "baby face" but I haven't gone gray or anything. I work out and shave more now than I did in my early 20s so I actually look better.

My parents are another story. At 50 my dad has has started to gray, bloat and wrinkle ... while my mom - despite some minor weight Gain - looks exactly the same as she did in her late 30s.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lgm2n</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t3dj</id></website><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/weve-got-an-exclusive-tenacious-d-minimovie-for-yo,71465/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T20:18:36+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:50:04+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3pksy</id><link>http://www.avclub.com/articles/weve-got-an-exclusive-tenacious-d-minimovie-for-yo,71465/#comment-480084921</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dozj8</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
