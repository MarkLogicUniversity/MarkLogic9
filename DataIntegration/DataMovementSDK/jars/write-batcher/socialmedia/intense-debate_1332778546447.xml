Any time a teen, a child, an adult, any American is killed we should all be sick about it!
But not hold open court before all the facts are in. 
If Zimmerman is guilty he will get his punishment!
Â However how many children were killed by guns, knives, clubs or other voilent means that went unreported this past week?
Why make it racial and have everyone tear at the fiber ofÂ  our country if one man was wrong. 
It is sad for America we don't get past this fanning the fire of racial hatred.
How can we move forward when no one says anything about the Black Panther Bounty on Zimmerman? 
This serves only the interest of those who want more division. I for one do not!
There must be Justice for those who are killed or injured regardless of their ethnicity!
We are all Gods children none better than another non less than another.

Those who fan the fire of division do so for self interest to make themselves relevant! 
They care more about the Spot light than justice!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r1m4f</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/o6hq</id></website><link>http://conservativebyte.com/2012/03/zimmerman-suffered-broken-nose-and-had-injury-to-back-of-head-he-was-attacked-by-trayvon-martin/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T04:55:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:43:36+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk1uyo</id><link>http://conservativebyte.com/2012/03/zimmerman-suffered-broken-nose-and-had-injury-to-back-of-head-he-was-attacked-by-trayvon-martin/#comment-476481232</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dj5t4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
