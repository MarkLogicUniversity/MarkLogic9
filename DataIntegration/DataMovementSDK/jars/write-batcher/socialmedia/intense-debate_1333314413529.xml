He saved the Auto Industry ?Â  Like Hell he did , thats Why Chrysler is now owned by Fiat and the Chevy Volt is a total dud .... And mind you GM will be back begging for more this year because they are losing money again hand over fist due to the unions ..they can't even sell that  piec of crap car over here in Europe to real Liberals .

2. He saved the Banks ?Â  Wrong Pal !Â Â  You mean to say He Saved the European Banks Like AEG and Paribas while bailing out Freddy mac and Fanny mae ...now the Euros took all the Money they could get and abscounded with it , or did you actually think they would open up a new branch up the street from you , thats a laugh ...and Freddy and Fanny are back at Congress while we speak begging for more bailout ....Maybe you should pay that bill instead of us since you are so fixedÂ with your retirement check which by the way is going to wind upÂ being a questionable situation for you in the coming year , have you ever eaten a can of dog food ?Â  You might just have to before the year is out ...

3.Â  Healtcare ? Obamacare is good for old folk ? you must be outta your cotton pickinÂ mind old man ...wait till you have to be taken to a Hospital for extensive geriatric care or have to enterÂ a nursing home then you will discover that ObamaCare is only about waiting in line being denied care and only seviceable for the young and those who are not terminally ill , and not for old bastards like you andÂ I, For you and I Â there are other options , such as end of life counciling and Comfort care through dope in the our last days to make us comfortable til the reaper comes a knockin , andÂ there is a distinct possibility that you will fall for that trap but not I , ..see you at the Death panels buddy ...

3. Jobs ?Â  SirÂ did your new prescription glasses arrive yet?  . apparently not because you haven't read a newspaper ..the forced outsourcing of our Jobs to foreign countries through high taxation and regulation has reduced the number of employment situations in America not the number of employable people ..Jobs have all been statistically erased to conform to the amount of Jobs available ...if the truth be known Unemployment is almost 20% and if you are Black definitely 20%,,if you are Young 17% and if you are disabled forget a Job and if you are Old don't bother applying ...go to a soup kitchen instead and figure it all out from one of the many tent cities now springing up around America  ..there are over 25 million homeless people since 2008 ..now how could that be ? ..and don't even try saying Obama inherited it , that doesn't work , Sure we know GW spent 3,5 triliion in 8 years with the onset of two wars , while Obama has already spent 5.5 trillion in 3 years for Bullshit  ..go figure what a trillion bucks looks like and you will be amazed to know that a trillion bucks in hundred dollar bills will stretch to the moon and back .

4. Ending US Involvement in Wars ?Â BULLSHIT !Â Â  What were we doing in Libya ;ast year with our Bombs and Planes ? , what are we doing in other parts of Africa since Obama took office?  , and instead of concluding the war in Iraq Obama snatched defeat from the Jaws of Victory as Muqtadah al Sadr and the Iranians are moving their people into place to over run the newly seated government and bring Irak down through occupation with their Al Qaeda pals ..Obama was also .aiding Al Qaeda to come to power in places like Egypt , Tunisia and Yemen are not ending US involvement in wars , but now he has hjis eyes set on Iran and Syria ,Obama would rather kick Israel in the balls  instead of creating secure situations for the entire Western world ..and an Appology to the Taliban for a couple of Burnt up Korans is crap when 4 US military had lost their lives being murdered in Cold blood  because of it ..You must beÂ loony old fellah  .

5. And lastly , Asking through Legislation to bringÂ American CompaniesÂ back inside US Borders ?Â  Are you nuts ?Â  what do you think Obama is going to do ? Â ,Get the Congress to send the Federal marshalls out toÂ go out and arrest the owners of our previous domestic American ccompaniesÂ who did the right thing and fled a high tax and spend administration and force them to come back here and re-open upÂ their businesses at gunpoint? If you think that, then you must be either totaly Mad or totally stupid ,,,and when it comes to the inside of our borders DUDE they are as leaky as a Sieve , so leaky that it's not the Mexicans we havce to fear , No sir , if you are not careful , Al Qaeda will be taking residence right up the street from your house and reast assured ,, they'll be coming over to your house for a neighborly cup of your blood ... Get a grip old man ..we don't have our heads in the Sand at all  ....but obviously you do have your head buried deeply up your Butt ...</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/ykg79w</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7oc8</id></website><link>http://mrctv.org/node/110641</link><postedTime>2012-03-02T20:20:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-05T15:56:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mnaehb</id><link>http://mrctv.org/node/110641#comment-456910474</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cefsc</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
