Copying SNSD, performing Hoot [*Cough* Pardon my mistake , I mean ATTEMPT], and now they're BASHING them ?Â 
They are in NO position to criticize SNSD , calling them "PLASTIC" and having no talent .
C Cup boobs , like I care? I want TALENT , not boobs -.- 
This group can't even sing or dance. And they're saying SNSD can't sing ?Â 
And Natural Beauty , AHAAAHH!! , no -.- I thought they were 30 something. Their oldest is 22 ? Wow . -.-
Using SNSD to  their popularity , whilst SNSD worked so hard to get to where they are today .
Plastic Surgery happens A LOT these days , is it so bad ? And even if they DID get plastic surgery , it was only minor . If you look at their pre-debut pictures, you can tell which SNSD member is which.
They need to be more humble, need to practice their singing more, their dancing more , and get their Act together , because right now they are in a VERY bad position .

SNSD HWAITING!
