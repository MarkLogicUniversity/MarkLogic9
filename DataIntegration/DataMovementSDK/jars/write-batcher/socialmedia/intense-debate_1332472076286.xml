In the US, outside of the greater metropolitan Miami area, little, if any, is knownÂ of the Cuban Five or Alan Gross for that matter. Anything that Obama does that reflectsÂ a positiveÂ or humanitarian gesture towards Cuba can only hurt him politically within the Cuban emigre community and potentially beyond to to undecided independent voter who still equates Cuba with the Cold War. On the other hand, in Cuba, the Cuban Five are national heroes and Alan Gross is almost as well-known throughout the island. Any positive gesture by Cuba only serves to reverse the largely negative international image Cuba maintains with regards to human rights. Chess, in Cuba, is a national pastime. The US sacrificed a pawn byÂ giving Gonzales a two-week pass to visit his ailing brother. As Anya stated, he has to return to the USÂ as directed. On the other hand,Â Cuba can conquer a bishop, if they were to magnanimously permit Gross to visit his mother and daughter. Their tacticalÂ mistake was allowing the US to move first with allowingÂ Gonzalez to travel. Had they granted Gross' petition first, they would have conquered a king.Â  Still, a bishop ain't bad.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6dp9co</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yoof</id></website><link>http://thehavananote.com/node/999</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T14:53:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T01:15:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mpbapb</id><link>http://thehavananote.com/node/999#comment-473000890</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h96as</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
