Both RTD and Moffat are and Always will be brilliant writers in their own rights. Doctor Who has changed so many times in tone, its pyshical characters and obviously look and how its shown as a whole due to the different styles of the producers and writers. RTD and Moffat are clear examples of that and have different approaches and different ideas how to bring the show alive, and in my opinion they both do a Spot on job. Obviously they both have their faults, RTD's was clearly his other use of drama, he relied too much on his characters sometimes with the whole returning to their families scenario and of course the over use of Daleks. RTD seemed to relish to much in the past which isn't a bad thing but a little originality really does help out.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67fypr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gztm</id></website><link>http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/not-another-davies-vs-moffat-debate-32182.htm</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T08:31:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T10:12:03+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwo9tv</id><link>http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/not-another-davies-vs-moffat-debate-32182.htm#comment-481710868</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h8743</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
