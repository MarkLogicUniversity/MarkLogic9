Looking at the various charts, I&amp;#039;d say the the way Cano has developed puts him on a very nice trend.  He&amp;#039;s not Alomar or Grich&amp;mdash;Pedroia projects to be more in their class&amp;mdash;but he&amp;#039;s outperforming guys like Kent and Soriano.  He might not be in the Hall of Fame category, but if he keeps on this path and stays a Yankee for most of his career, he certainly could be in the Retired Number category. 
 
With respect to your overarching point: It&amp;#039;s Spot-on.  I agree completely.  What we should see is a relatively steady slope on his career WAR graph followed by an eventual tapering and plateau&amp;mdash;NOT an increasing slope (which would represent better seasons over time).  I see him sort of mirroring Kent&amp;#039;s career arc as they are very similar players in many ways. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:217521:127835244</id><idPostId>127835244</idPostId><idBlogId>217521</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:217521</id><idBlogId>217521</idBlogId><link>http://itsabout.server304.com</link><displayName>It&amp;#039;s About The Money</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://itsaboutthemoney.net/archives/2012/03/30/what-we-know-about-robinson-cano/</link><displayName>What we know about Robinson Cano</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:37:48.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:217521:127835244:327954428</id><link>http://itsaboutthemoney.net/archives/2012/03/30/what-we-know-about-robinson-cano/#IDComment327954428</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:37:48.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on What we know about Robinson Cano by Jay M.</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link/><idEmailMd5>c6379f7c59cd70aeff2a4d8e2d89a77a</idEmailMd5><displayName>Jay M.</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>Jay M. commented on &lt;a href="http://itsaboutthemoney.net/archives/2012/03/30/what-we-know-about-robinson-cano/"&gt;What we know about Robinson Cano&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
