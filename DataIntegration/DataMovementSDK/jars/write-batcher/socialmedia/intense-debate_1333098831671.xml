I suspect that, in the unlikely event that the Court does not find the mandate to be legal under the taxing power (see the last 62 seconds of oral arguments on Tuesday), the Chief will try to not scuttle the entire law.  The argument that the Congress should work this out cuts two ways.  GOP partisans want to advantage the GOP by repealing the entire law, while Democratic Partisans want to advantage the Democrats by leaving current law in place, making sure that nay repeal provisions must garner 60 votes and therefore be bipartisan.  The other option is split Medicare and Medicaid provisions  and keep them in place and scuttle the rest - which would be Cold Comfort to all those folks who gave money because they object to higher taxes on the wealthy (both on wages and non-wage income) and want it repealed, but glommed on the repealing mandates as a vehicle for doing so.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hwjm6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/qytj</id></website><link>http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2012/03/28/If-Mandate-Goes-How-Much-Goes-With-It.aspx</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T01:09:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:19:55+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3j6l4</id><link>http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2012/03/28/If-Mandate-Goes-How-Much-Goes-With-It.aspx#comment-479963682</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/yv4s0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
