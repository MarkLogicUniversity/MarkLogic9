The initial report-available on line-says he was Bleeding. It does not say his nose was broken and police routinely send people with injuries to hospitals to document them.

''? 
Seriously you racist piece of shit? Not content to blame the victim you have to add insult to injury by mocking black people's speech?

Disgusting.

" Everything is alleged until it is proven... "

Nope. Some things are undeniable. That this lawyer has to stretch the facts so far to even begin to make a case should tell you that.

 â€œI assume he hit him in the face and caused him to fall back and hit his head.â€&#157;

An Olympic boxer would have been strained to get in that good a punch.

"As for failing to prosecute, can you explain why the DOJ refused to 
prosecute the two black panther members for voter intimidation in 
Chicago???Â  "

WTF? 

"....The polling place was in a majority-black precinct that has long voted
 Democratic. Most of the voters there hardly needed to be intimidated 
into voting for Obama.Besides, when a police officer was summoned
 and told Shabazz to leave the area, he did. That might help to explain 
why then-Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham's office says it 
received no complaints of intimidation from the precinct.
Yet, 
shortly before the Bush administration left office in January 2009, the 
civil rights division filed a lawsuit alleging voter intimidation by the
 two men, plus their chairman and organization." Â  Â  Chicago Tribune

There was no crime to investigate, you fucking racist piece of shit.
And the entire 'New Black Panther Party' has three actual members and a website that hasn't been updated in four years.
