In 2010 everyone was given a seemingly unlimited number of opportunities to succeed. Last season there was a lot of tough talk, but still plenty of patience. Now--even in Spring Training--an ERA under 2.00 doesn't necessarily guarantee anything. We're talking about well hit and "loud" outs these days. Undoubtedly the pitching staff is feeling the most Heat, but I've noticed the position players really busting their butts getting down to first even on the most routine ground balls. It's all good, just a shock to my system!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67t4r3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/z6fr</id></website><link>http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2012/03/simon-placed-on-waivers.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T00:20:14+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T12:53:34+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwio7q</id><link>http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2012/03/simon-placed-on-waivers.html#comment-481806703</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/l61w0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
