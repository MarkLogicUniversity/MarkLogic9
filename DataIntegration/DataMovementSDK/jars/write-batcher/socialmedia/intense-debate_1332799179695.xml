To my opinion the â€œall of the aboveâ€&#157; approach to future energy developments, include the present development based on hydrocarbons and coal including the rest, the experimental or commercial renames energies.  This approach for the future, embrace the long period of time to the transition from non-renewable that one day soon or latter will be scarce, to the renewable clean energies, being wind, sun or other energies.  
I think that the USA energy policy has not been dysfunctional during 40 years, and as an argument I will say that during these times until now, the USA economy has been growing, and this cannot be done without energy. During these times, USA has developed the coal industry, the oil and gas industry, and other energies, and all the energy resources are used to fuel the growing economy and keeping millions jobs in USA.
My opinion is that USA has been and is and will be independent on energy.  So USA is self-sufficient on coal, the gas production has increased and gas resources, using new technologies are increased and on near future USA may be self-sufficent and probably will export gas.  USA is independent on other energies too.  USA is ranked on third place on oil production rates, and on the circumstances that USA imports about 50 % of the consumption, this is because the consumption is extremely high.  No one will be blamed for the oil consumption, but I think that USA has been able to find the oil needed from oil producing countries, and the oil has been relatively cheap for every citizen. Today, that the gasoline price in USA is high, and increased from the low price it has before, the price of this gasoline is a way cheaper than the EU countries.  Do the USA citizens know this?  Of course they do.
The energy independence is great argument, and for more than 40 years the USA dream has been being energy independent.  I explained something above, but I will add here my opinion that USA can be energy independent on the future.  Many things, can change, new discoveries can be done and must be done.  
Everybody knows that the non-renewable energy resources are huge, but energy reserves that we can produce and use to fuel the economy, are restricted.  On other side we have consumed all the produced energy reserves, having low efficiency.  We have low efficiency on energy when the energy is used driving the cars, when we produce electric energy, when we Heat or cool our homes, when we run our appliances or lighting our homes.
So everybody has a wide area to research, discover and use to increase the efficiencies.  When we will have done this, we can be energy independent and our resources will last longer.  The other field to research and improve is the field of increasing the recovery factor from energy resources.  Let we increase the oil and gas recovery, and USA may be energy independent on other decades.
What the USA has left under the ground on the oil and gas reservoirs that already are discover and producing, can be astonishing.  The oil remained on the tiny rock pores of the rocks, thousands of feet beneath the earth, on shore or offshore, is estimated to be 650 billion barrel oil.  Haw much of this oil can be produced on the future?  My opinion is that we can produce 10-25 % more from this oil, even this can arrive and 50% more.  The math shows that 65 to 165 billion barrel oil can be produced; even 325 billion barrel is probable.  So there is a hope, and if we have the solution, than USA can be energy independent for more 10 to 25 years and probable 50 years if the consumption will be 18 mm bbld. 
 So, we have the possibility only, but we need a solution, a cheap and affordable new technology, a technology that will have no restriction, and that can bring the oil flow with the required rates.  We have the possibility, and we show the astonishing calculations.  This is not the solution.
Because we do not have the solution, we exaggerate and we are scared for the future, for the scarcity of the oil energy for high price.  This preoccupation is right, but I thing we do not need to panic.
The world is awash with oil, heavy oil, gas, tar sand, bitumen, shale gas and shale oil, coal.  I do not mention here the kerogen on oil shale and the gas hydrates.  And the reserves of liquid hydrocarbons in the tiny pores all over the world are estimated 9.5-15 trillion barrels.  Accounting the oil consumed until now that is around 1 trillion barrel, and the oil to be produced on the near future, estimated around 1 trillion, then the trapped oil, subject to be recovered with new technologies is 7.5-13 trillion barrel.  This is what I say it is not time to panic.  
Joining the environmentalists, I understand the pollution problems, and I want the renewable energies now, I want these energies cheep and affordable, to run my car and to Heat my home and use the energy for a normal life, for a normal business.  Such energy is not available, but I think, we all have to subsidise the new recoverable energies and gradually advance and replace the non-renewable finite fossil energies. I agree with environmentalists, that the world will have consequences if the fossil energy will continue to pollute our world.  But, let we use the fossils until we can replace the non-renewable.  If we will be not able to use the resources we have, if we will not be lucky to discover new renewable energies that we want, if we will be scarce on investments and scarce on energy, the life will not be as before, the world consequences may be even worse than the environmental problems. 
I am not presenting here the calculations to scare environmentalists, or to panic peoples.  This is an exercise to show that I am trying to do my job.  And my job has been related with oil and gas industry.  I understand well what many specialists thing in regards to oil prices, oil production rates in the world, the oil decline rates on the world, the peak of oil reservoir discovery, the ultimate oil recovery possible, the oil remaining inside the tiny pores, new technologies, new unconventional reservoirs, etc.  The specialists, based on their opinions and knowledge, are divided on optimist that consider the peak oil but the peaks will happens latter, after which will come a plateau.  The opposite, are those who thing the peak has happened, is present now or will come shortly.  
I will position myself on the first group.  I know that the conventional reservoirs, most have past the maximum production rates, and some oil reservoirs, have more potential on future development and this includes infill drillings, horizontal drillings, multifracture, EOR applications.  The decline of oil reservoir is a natural phenomenon and cannot be ignored.  But with the scientific development and optimization of oil reservoirs, the decline can be reduced, or if EOR are successfully applied, the trend of oil production can increase and later it will decline without being able for future interventions.
Based on the knowledge I have, I can say that the world have potential to increase the oil production rates up to around 95-100 mm bbld, from around 90 mm bbld actually.  This can be done with reasonable effective investments.  The world oil production can increase gradually, and we can arrive 100 mm bbld around year 2025, after this the world oil production will decline around 4.5-6.5 % year or less.  
The production with the above rates, possible by using known technologies, shows that the peak has not arrived yet, and it is very probable to come around year 2025, having only a decade time to continue our business as usually, and our life as usually, accepting the actual prices as reasonable and affordable.  We know that to be prepared for the peak oil and the decline on production will require a quick action, to discover new renewable energies that can be used with simple modification on all cars, on all transportations tracks, aviation, on all agriculture mechanisms, and do not forget on the military.  This new-renewable energy required within a decade of time, required to replace the oil without or with easy and cheap modifications, is very difficult to be find.  So, we are late to discover our new renewable energy, so desperately required from all of us, and the new renewable energies that we actually know, are expensive, cannot be applied faster, are not attractive for investitures, cannot replace the hydrocarbons, and we are not able to invest on huge proportions to replace our cars, the transportation track, airplanes and other.
So, I think that the serious problem that we have, the USA has and every country have, must be considered as serious, very serious, but still here is not the time to suffer the consequences of the delay we have on new discoveries, still is not time to panic and as , we do not surrender, we will try and be ready to fight and solve the problem.  But haw?
I will say first let analyze what we have, what we know and what we need.
We have one decade time to continue the business as usually, and the life as usually if we want.  But during this time, we have to do researches to increase the efficiency on oil consumption, we have to work hard to discover new renewable affordable energies, we have to work and discover other way for transportation and other development required for a normal life a normal development.  
Many people, scientist and inventor work hard to arrive and solve the problems, many times they fail to discover in time what is desperately required, and even they fail, they work harder, they learn more, they discover other things probably â€œaccidentlyâ€&#157;, and they never surrender. 
I hope that this time, the scientists, the researchers and inventors together with investitures, being these private or government investment and subsidiaries, will arrive to win the lost time, and have success that within a decade, do the gradual replacement of non-renewable fossil energies with renewable clean energies.
All of us know that about 55-60% of oil produced is used on transportation, including here the cars we use on everyday work and life.  I thing that at least after 2025, the oil will live us, so if other energy resources are not discovered, we gradually must change the way of life we live, and this means we have to use more and more public transportation, and living the scarce and expensive oil to be used as fuel on aviation, on agriculture and other industries.  This gasoline price increase will save our economic development, will save our jobs, and will give us more time to make efforts to discover what we need.  
Estimating the oil used as fuel for transportation, it actually is around 50 to 54 mm bbld.  If we are forced to live oil, and initially we will save only 25 % of the oil we use, it is 25 to 27 mm bbld.  This means that with decline rates 4.5-6.5% year that we accept after the year 2025, and then the world can use oil until 2030 to 2032.  If the world will save all the oil used on private cars, then the economy can run until the years 2036 to 2040, having 24 years to 28 years time to gradually live the oil as fuel.  So, the world never, never will panic, even when we think that we are running out of time.  
The whistleblowers, do not panic us, they only make us more responsible.  And I thing that this gradual transition, and living the oil will satisfy all the environmentalists, and the rest of the peoples, that need and use the oil.
Indeed, we never will live the oil remaining on tiny pores, we will produce it as a precious commodity, we only do not want to Burn it by fueling our cars, and keeping the way we live and work that we actually have.  The precious oil, being these even heavy or even and bitumen, will be used from us and from other generations.  The oil will be used on industries and produce plastic materials; it will be used to produce different detergent and fertilizers or even different medicines, it will be used to pave our highways and other uses.  So, we have a big chain where the oil can be used, and the oil production will continue, and the oil business will need not to produce the trapped oil on the tiny capillaries or pores of the rocks, but to discover on harsh environment, deep seas and on high temperatures under the earth.
My opinion and my knowledge, says that we can produce this oil if we need it, and we can produce it using cheap technologies that requires modest investments, and that oil can be produced with relatively cheap affordable gasoline prices, prices that we actually see in the marked.   
The oil discovery and oil production cost are increased gradually, and this has been related with the inflation, with increased expenses on new discoveries, and the new discoveries  have been on difficult location, smaller on dimensions, more difficult to produce, and other expenses.
The actually crude oil prices, that we indirectly pay, are somehow reasonable, to pay back the expenses, to pay for new researches and new drillings, to pay a reasonable profit.  I think that the actually reasonable high prices are here to stay.  The future crude oil prices, probably will adjust only for the inflation, if the economy will have inflation.  And with these prices, we will see EOR applications on oil fields, and we will be able to discover and use new technologies.
I said that the world is awashed with oil and we never will use all the will is discovered and use it as a fuel for our cars.  Never the world wills panic, and the oil business will continue to exist and serve the peoples and the business that need the oil.  
The known technologies used in crude oil production will live 7.5-13 trillion in the pores and 10-25 % or even 50% of this oil can be produced with new technologies yet to be discovered.  This gives us that 1.3 to 3.25 trillion barrel oil or even 6.5 trillion barrels oil, can be produced and flood the oil market with reasonable demand.  Based on the maximal supply that the world can afford and supposing that the market will match with the demand, which is about 100 mm bbld, the world can run the economy for 36 years to 89 years after 2025 or even more is possible, up to 178 years after 2025. Yes, I am not joking, I am talking seriously, and based on knowledge.  The remaining oil can be produced, if needed, with reasonable investment, and producing crude oil with reasonable affordable prices, and beneficiary for the investments.  This can be done, today tomorrow or when it is needed, if the world will need it.  
I hope the world, and USA in particular will develop new clean energies as soon as the technologies are needed.  I hope to, that the world needs the oil I am talking, for using it on industry as a commodity, not Burning it as fuel.  I say if the need for that oil is, the solution, or one of the solutions needed, already is available.  Where there is a need, the solution is hear and waiting for applications.  The panic is unreasonable, and the needs of the world for energy, on the case to develop the world as usually, are guaranteed.  The peak of oil I will consider the year 2025, and after this time, the world can stay at the plateau or decries the production by a well studied plan.  The  of oil never will end, but the supply  will match the demand, and the future prices will be reasonable.
The USA in particularly, on my opinion is a country with a lot of oil resources, and the independence on energy, or on hydrocarbon liquids, is achievable.  The energy independence will not come by itself, it may come if the oil companies want to achieve there, and the companies have all the possibilities, the companies have the resources, but need the right applications.
The peak of knowledge never comes, and if the finite resources, talking for oil, will be used on a rational way and benefit during all times.  The knowledge does not have limits, peoples will find Always solutions and the life will progress.
