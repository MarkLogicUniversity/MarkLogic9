It looked real, felt like you were there, in a big machine in deep space. No other Science Fiction film I ever experienced gave me quite the sensation of being there. Far from help. Then, when Ridley Scott revealed Giger's ship...and finally Giger's Alien-it was all the more terrifying. First, however, he put you there. With very ordinary people (the crew), in the Cold dark distances where no one can hear you scream.   </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zxbt6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/cl6z</id></website><link>http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/scifi/prometheus-watered-pg13-rating.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:24:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:36:44+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3fgpd</id><link>http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/scifi/prometheus-watered-pg13-rating.html#comment-479864492</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/88sx3</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
