Since I started watching The Walking Dead, my main point in trying to persuade others to watch it is that it reminds me so much of LOST. I wasn't necessarily referring to the characters (even though I think your comparisons are Spot-on), but more in a community survival/trying to make a life for themselves way.

Also, just a point of interest - Robert Kirkman apologized for the lack of T-Bone/Dog in the second season, saying that he'll get more of a focus. Poor, poor T.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hvr7o</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/jnfe</id></website><link>http://www.tvasylum.com/blog/2012/03/28/the-lostness-of-the-walking-dead/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T15:28:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:22:36+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3n0ir</id><link>http://www.tvasylum.com/blog/2012/03/28/the-lostness-of-the-walking-dead/#comment-479670131</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ca0t</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
