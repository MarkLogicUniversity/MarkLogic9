Â  Get rid of that ghetto mentality that you are a victim of the man. Pick yourself up and  like a man or woman who is proud to be you, and get Off the Cry-baby train.
Â  Trayvon was out with burglary tools and womens jewelry in his back-pack so he wasn't coming back from church or visiting a sick friend. He shouldn't have been out at 2 or 3 in the morning, period.
Â  His post was that he was a "made gangsta" which usually means he has killed someone to prove his place in a gang. His bad choices cost him his life. When the facts come to light, he was a burglar that paid the ultimate price for his crimes.
Â  Zimmerman should not have been in the position to shoot this guy and the courts will straighten that out without all the rioting and revenge that is now being planned.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hkomp</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/jpbk</id></website><link>http://theweek.com/article/index/226172/why-is-trayvon-martins-mother-trademarking-his-name</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T22:10:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:39:48+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwhls6</id><link>http://theweek.com/article/index/226172/why-is-trayvon-martins-mother-trademarking-his-name#comment-480993418</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>flagged</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
