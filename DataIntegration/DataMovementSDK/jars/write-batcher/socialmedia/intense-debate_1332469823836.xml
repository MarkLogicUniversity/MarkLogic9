From an engine standpoint, those old Hondas ran extremely lean while cruising, and thus got very good gas mileage at the expense of much higher NOx emissions than running stoichiometrically. Our currentÂ emissionsÂ requirements preclude the application of such a lean Burn, thus mpg has decreased. We have at the same time added a massive amount of weight to the vehicle (mostly in the name of safety, but also Comfort, convenience, etc) and made car engines larger and more powerful, which both decrease mpg as well.

It may seemÂ counterintuitiveÂ that in the name of environmentalÂ stewardshipÂ (decreasing emissions) we decrease mpg, but that's just how it works given that NOx is regulated but CO2 isn't. In the magic ICE triangle, you have emissions, efficiency and power, and while bettering 2 is easy at the expense of the third, bettering all 3 is very tricky (although we are getting much better at making powerful, efficient engines with direct injection and turbocharging. It's tough to make a large engine that is efficient across all output levels).

Turbo diesels are another story, and arguably theirÂ prevalenceÂ in the US compared to Europe is driven mostly by emissions regulations as well. The EU regulates emissions with a different priority than the US, one that favors the diesel emissions more (they allow more NOx and are looking at CO2 IÂ believe, although I could be wrong about that).</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6dik0t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/y2ru</id></website><link>http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/21/nissan-leaf-upgrade-2013/</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T15:45:17+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-21T18:09:44+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mphtxs</id><link>http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/21/nissan-leaf-upgrade-2013/#comment-472601444</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lqvlq</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
