Also two witnesses support Martins side of the story but I still would rather an official police report to come out before passing judgement. You on the otherhand want it to be about Race. How much do you care that a young teen was Burned for being white by two older and bigger black kids? Was that racist to you? Where is the outrage on that incident? It is racist to support crimes for only one race? It is racist to call an random Act without evidence racists? What does that make many on this board? Racists!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67i5gb</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/31/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:47:24+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T15:31:08+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw3di2</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/31/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-481921272</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6jyxl</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
