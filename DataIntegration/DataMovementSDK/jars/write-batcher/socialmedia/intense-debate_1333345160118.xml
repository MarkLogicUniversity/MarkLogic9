What's sad, and frustrating, is that in most big metro cities in the US, on any given weekend, as a trauma surgeon, on Saturday morning I will have black parents crying on my shoulder and asking aloud "why" as I try to console them after yet another black on black lethal and vicious slaying in Cold blood.  It seems at least 1 in 3 are totally and so sadly innocent having just been in the same club or street where the shooting took place.  Oftentimes, especially during summer months when neighborhood kids are near outdoor parties, the stray bullets hit children.  The friends of the departed will be in the hospital lobby plotting revenge.  On my way home I'll hear cars next to me playing loud and violent music.  I come back the next nite and do it all over again.  

Where are the national protests for the four-year-old African-American child whose brains are being scraped Off the floor by the custodian and put in the red biohazard trashbag?      

In the end I just drive home, bewildered and tired, after another brain-f@!# of a weekend.   </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67i5gb</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/31/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:47:24+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T19:04:20+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0aeco</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/31/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-482104360</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z73op</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
