The reality of this modern age is that projects like these are designed to feed more money to the rich.

With most of the wealth of this country tied up in the hands of the super rich, the rest of us have lost any desire to promote economic incentive legislation, because it never seems to benefit anyone but the rich.

This is part of how the downfall begins. The poeple no longer have faith that the economic system they live in will allow them to prosper.. it only allows them to get by. The 1% have hoarded so much cash that it is now not possible for the avg American to earn a decent wage.

When the 1% start to understand that we all lose when they hoard all the cash, we might see some change.... but.. the greedy did not accumulate all that wealth by spending it... they got it by being greedy... Trickle down is the 2nd biggest lie of the last 30 years... WMD takes the #1 Spot for me.....</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67ltzb</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dngw</id></website><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/30/opinion/editorials/maine-is-better-off-being-on-the-way-to-somewhere/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T19:51:05+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T13:34:26+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwklpf</id><link>http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/30/opinion/editorials/maine-is-better-off-being-on-the-way-to-somewhere/#comment-481833133</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/h5rwi</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
