When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids". 

He should have left it that his death was a tragedy that should be thoroughly investigated by local law enforcement and the state of Florida.  As President he should not have personalized it... it isn't Always about Obama.  Obama supporter Van Jones is just Itching for violent confrontations. Now if blacks start going after Hispanics Obama may lose some of the Hispanic vote that he wouldn't have lost if he had behaved more presidentially.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r1e2k</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tc48</id></website><link>http://www.noquarterusa.net/blog/66167/yes-there-is-higher-turnout/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T04:52:31+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:39:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkuftv</id><link>http://www.noquarterusa.net/blog/66167/yes-there-is-higher-turnout/#comment-476437444</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cvw7k</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
