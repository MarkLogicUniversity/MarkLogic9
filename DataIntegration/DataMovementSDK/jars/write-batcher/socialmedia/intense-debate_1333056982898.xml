Shump also starting to see how he can use his upper body strength to his advantage against smaller guards while attacking the bucket! 

His defense gets him going! Yeah yeah he's going to through up some bricks from time to time, but he keeps the defense honest is what I love about his game.

Whenever the ball is being moved around the perimeter and it hits Landry Fields hand, he kills it by ALWAYS PLAYING PITY PAT WITH THE ROCK TO SAY, why did your pass it to me? Thank you coach Woodson by getting his butt OUTTER THERE! He's a nice guy and an awesome slasher and rebounder, but is out of his element frontin as a 2 guard. It's not his fault if the coach keep sticking him there:(</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zl6om</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/lilw</id></website><link>http://www.theknicksblog.com/2012/03/29/shumperts-jumper-makes-knicks-a-different-team/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:33:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:51:19+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m34lvu</id><link>http://www.theknicksblog.com/2012/03/29/shumperts-jumper-makes-knicks-a-different-team/#comment-479546519</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c9pvs</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
