This may be her Snake, but it is not the end, and she should take heart. Suffice to say that Mofaz is a Likud Trojan Horse whether or not he knows it. Consider that before the elections he argued for a unity government position and then before waiting for his official appointment has launched a battle in the opposition for the office of next PM. In so doing he has established a precedent of conflict between Labor, Haaretz, and Kadima that will  Likud the election through a divide and conquer Sherman March approach. His past history gives no evidence of impetuosity but rather a Cold and calculated advancement. It could therefore be that he has likely made private overtures to allow himself and his closest supporters positions in the next government. Suspecting this I recommend Livni approach both Labor and Haaretz to secure positions for her close supporters who will be evicted soon and begin formulating an agreement to alter Mofaz's faÃ§ade of opposition leasership. It will come to many in Kadima as shock when they realize just what damage Mofaz is doing to the opposition. In order to secure a position in the upcoming government and see an end to the Arab conflict with Israel, I suggest a strategy to force peace with the PA on Israelâ€™s terms. This requires Israel to cultivate its own Arab citizenry as the only viable partner for peace. It is necessary to focus internal Arab and Druze interest in creating a constitution that provides the legal framework for separate but equal rights. By establishing Israel with federal oversight over the West Bank and Gaza which will remain Governorates of the Palestinian National Authority within an Arab - Israeli confederation we can enlist our Israeli Arab population to unilaterally challenge the PLO and the PA. In effect a constitution would alter the balance of consensus and establish a minimum entry point for the PA in negotiations. The greater the Israeli Arab and Druze consensus in support of the constitution and its implementation the greater the public demand with in the PA will become to negotiate. In a worst case scenario it will be necessary to field Arab IDF units to impose this consensus on Gaza and the West Bank. This is unlikely since the PA will experience increasing degrees of public pressure to negotiate. Only Iran and its Palestinian supporters will eventually form the core opposition and by then Egyptâ€™s military will be disposed to support Israelâ€™s Arab population over them. The major issue is Gaza which must be forced into the PA Arab sphere, either by Egypt or eventually by Arab IDF units in support of Israeli Arab consensus. Currently with out a constitution the Israeli Supreme Court and Knesset become the battle field for leveraged engagements for and against Arabs and Jews. A constitution will allow the establishment of a balance of powers between the administrative, judicial, and legislative branches that can prevent the past excesses of authority from happening again. It can also establish a bill of rights that lays the foundation for this peace. The idea of isolation has historically been a populist notion that eventually succumbs to outside threats. That reality dictates the need for Israel to grow its own domestic Arab consensus in order to  all its security issues before the iron wall is eroded by demographic and political threats. The IDF is a temporary measure for Israelâ€™s security because escalating costs will eventually drive Jews from Israel even when missile and security threats do not. No one wants to live in a bankrupt state just as no one wants to live under constant threat of missile and terrorist attacks. My suggestion creates an internal dynamic for peace that forces the PA to either negotiate or be assimilated. Nothing is easy, least of all building this consensus. I do not suggest this as a measure but rather a goal. If we want to avoid the Snakes in Israeli politics it sometimes becomes necessary to navigate around our obstacles to Reach the next Ladder.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6taltx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/8cxx</id></website><link>http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=264454</link><postedTime>2012-04-02T08:48:31+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T08:56:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0omlj</id><link>http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=264454#comment-483365691</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dvkjb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
