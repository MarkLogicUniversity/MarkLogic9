Am I to take it then that, in your eyes, no-one should ever comment on something written or said? 
Now that&amp;#039;s interesting. 
If &amp;quot;shameless pot&amp;quot; is not an insult, then what is it? Why did you write it? I hardly contributes anything to debate, imho. 
If I call you a &amp;quot;shameless kettle&amp;quot; how does that advance the discussion? 
However I will remember that your insults will be more pointed, I&amp;#039;ll keep that in my &amp;quot;state of mind&amp;quot;. 
 
&amp;quot;rebutt ? refute? Are you joking again all of them are statements and delivered with or without goals.&amp;quot; 
No, I&amp;#039;m not joking. I&amp;#039;m offering you the opportunity to show that any one of &amp;quot;them&amp;quot; are wrong Islamically speaking (assuming that we are talking about the article statements of course). 
 
&amp;quot;If you have problems with those statements thats your Headache why should I worry?&amp;quot; 
Why indeed? Spoken like a Good Muslim, Interesting. Why indeed should you worry about Islamic aims of world-domination, the subjugation of all non-Muslims, calls to mass-murder Jews, statements about the worthlessness of non-Muslims, use of non-Muslims as &amp;quot;ghanima&amp;quot;, sex-slaves etc. After all, I assume that you would expect to get some of the &amp;quot;spoils as well, which are not yet within your Reach but Allah has surely encompassed them [for you].&amp;quot; 
 Of course, it&amp;#039;s a bit different from the non-Muslim perspective, but I doubt you can appreciate that fully. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:278853:127946460</id><idPostId>127946460</idPostId><idBlogId>278853</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:278853</id><idBlogId>278853</idBlogId><link>http://www.faithfreedom.org/wordpress</link><displayName>FaithFreedom.org</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.faithfreedom.org/articles/islamic-jihad-articles/in-the-words-of-the-imams/</link><displayName>In the words of the Imams</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T14:29:14.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:278853:127946460:330004335</id><inReplyTo><link>http://www.faithfreedom.org/articles/islamic-jihad-articles/in-the-words-of-the-imams/#IDComment329391554</link></inReplyTo><link>http://www.faithfreedom.org/articles/islamic-jihad-articles/in-the-words-of-the-imams/#IDComment330004335</link><postedTime>2012-04-02T14:29:14.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on In the words of the Imams by jonmc</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link/><idEmailMd5>e2755aab0f9e5aa584128e04d864cd54</idEmailMd5><displayName>jonmc</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>jonmc commented on &lt;a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/articles/islamic-jihad-articles/in-the-words-of-the-imams/"&gt;In the words of the Imams&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-04-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
