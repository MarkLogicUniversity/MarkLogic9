Â The energy advancements have lead to a massive expansion in the human population. Â The medical advancements lead to great things, but also something unexpected.We disrupted evolution. Â We now are able to keep people alive, and Ensure life in to reproductive years for people who not even 100 years ago would have died early in life, or have been shunned and excluded from the gene pool (not saying it was right, just telling the truth). Â As a result, we have increased prevalence of the genes and genetic disorders that cause a myriad of issues, not just autism but asthma etc. increasing in density year after year in those reproducing.We can keep most of these people alive, and we can keep them reproducing - but we can not yet cure the diseases. Â Only when we get there are we going to see numbers drop, in the mean time they must increase because their genetic prevalence is increasing.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zh1xd</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/health/autism/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:36:35+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:35:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3knr6</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/health/autism/index.html#comment-480163222</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dgsw1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
