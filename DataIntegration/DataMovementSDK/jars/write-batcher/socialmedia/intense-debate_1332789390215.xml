And we can thank the politically correct panty-waste liberal Bleeding hearts for it too.

Life's rough. Get a helmut. I once had a "customer service" rep tell me that I was emotionally abusing her and she would be forced to terminate the call. I was angry, and although I was not swearing or yelling, I was asking some pointed questions. So I responded:

"If you don't want me to be angry, then your company needs to stop doing things that piss me . Now if you can't deal with an unhappy customer, please put someone on the phone who can."

I guess sheÂ is a generation YÂ crybaby and she did not think it was right for me, a dissatisfied customer, to give her a "negative workplace experience". I am supposed to be civil when people rip me Off and then lie about it later and try to cover it up with BS excuses and creative accounting? They can do that but being ANGRY is offensive? I guess that's our world today.
