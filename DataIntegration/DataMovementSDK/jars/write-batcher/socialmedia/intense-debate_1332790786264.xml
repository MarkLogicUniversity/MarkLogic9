He is one of the few "midcard" guys that do a limited main event run and be looked at as credible. Think of it like this back in the day "Buff" Bagwell was a midcard guy and if he was forced to work above that he struggled mightily. Christian on the other hand was forced into the spotlight because of EDGE getting injured and was credible as a Main Eventer with Del Rio. So in my humble opinion if Christian is no more than a mid carder the rest of his WWE days he proved he could hang in the main event. 

As far as leaving TNA for a Spot on WWEÂ  I see it as a chance for him to prove beyond a doubt that he was good enough to main event in WWE as well. He did well in TNA as their go to guy. So why not try and see if he can make some better money and get to the point that you can move the Dial. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l26r4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/e1x9</id></website><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0326/551050/christian-cage/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:33:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:17:20+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk9ex2</id><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0326/551050/christian-cage/#comment-476552916</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8njrq</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
