	All of the feed backs here have their own points. Yes, it really happens that an Internet Service Provider exceeds their number of subscribers in one place. That is why the speed of your connection is affected. But I guess that is not the main reason why subscribers experience a slow connection. The speed of your connection all  on the package that you have availed from your Internet Service Provider. If the package you availed doesn&amp;#39;t even Reach 1MBPS, then it is more likely that you will really experience a slow connection. The considerable speed that you should avail from an Internet Service Provider is 1MBPS above, and anything lower than that will only give you a Headache. Hope this helps.....&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
