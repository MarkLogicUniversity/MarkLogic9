Â Sorry to offend you, but nobody here is going to disagree with your information, but what the heck does that have to do with what we are facing, in our society, right now? Â If the Islamic faith, or words in books about Islam, spread messages of hatred and death to all those that don't believe, then that is a BIG problem. Â Don't bring up, oh didn't Hitler do this and didn't Mussolini do this......it's a childish response. Â Grow up and watch what is transpiring around you. Â Your and moreover, your children's way of life would be drastically changed if this Islamic way of thinking were to overtake our country. Â Seriously, people like you really tick me Off. Â If the words are in black and white for us all to read, it's not like we're making it up. Â They hate the western world, they hate us, and they want to destroy us. Â End of story!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67tu33</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/zsj8</id></website><link>http://www.torontosun.com/2012/03/30/more-controversial-muslim-books-for-sale-in-toronto</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T00:29:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T03:04:58+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwuxwc</id><link>http://www.torontosun.com/2012/03/30/more-controversial-muslim-books-for-sale-in-toronto#comment-481471707</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/l3ebm</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
