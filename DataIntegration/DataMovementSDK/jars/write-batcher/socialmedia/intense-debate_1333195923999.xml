I have visited schools that to all outward appearances looked very functional pleasant environments and then a few months later I found that they were being torn down and rebuilt! While all the while I and many of my colleagues were teaching in damp leaky drafty Cold mobile huts. What&amp;#039;s going on?  
In certain parts of the place almost every other school is a rebuild. while in other places like the school mentioned above it has been remained alos battle for decades. Seems to me, reading between the lines it is down to who you know, and if you Shout loudest and then of course many of these rebuilds have political associations. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:184182:127899224</id><idPostId>127899224</idPostId><idBlogId>184182</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:184182</id><idBlogId>184182</idBlogId><link>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk</link><displayName>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/disheartened-headmaster-steps-down-after-years-of-trying-to-get-funding-to-rebuild-his-old-school-16138394.html</link><displayName>Disheartened headmaster steps down after years of trying to get funding to rebuild his old school - </displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T12:10:41.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:184182:127899224:328479104</id><link>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/disheartened-headmaster-steps-down-after-years-of-trying-to-get-funding-to-rebuild-his-old-school-16138394.html#IDComment328479104</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T12:10:41.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on Disheartened headmaster steps down after years of trying to get funding to rebuild his old school -  by TJMcClean</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://intensedebate.com/people/TJMcClean</link><idEmailMd5>866246f0d95c249a6f5d34e061d7a351</idEmailMd5><displayName>TJMcClean</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/people/TJMcClean"&gt;TJMcClean&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/disheartened-headmaster-steps-down-after-years-of-trying-to-get-funding-to-rebuild-his-old-school-16138394.html"&gt;Disheartened headmaster steps down after years of trying to get funding to rebuild his old school - &lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
