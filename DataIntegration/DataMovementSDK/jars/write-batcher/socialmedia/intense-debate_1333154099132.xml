Because they've yet to devise a way to tax the energy generated by self owned renewables.....they can't think of how to replace the tax stream from highly insulated passive housing.

Council landlords use other peoples money, private don't.

Landlords have been stripped of many rights &amp; you seem to know little about it.............your assumption they are making money hand over fist is incorrect &amp; very often do not actually move into a positive investment for 3/4 years...........add to that occupancy is nearer an average of 9/10 months/ann &amp; tenants very often Ensure that money needs to be spent of refurbishment before re-let &amp; so much more etc, etc you really need to understand the market........as I said I wouldn't touch residentiual letting with yours even though it is having a touch the rennaissance about it at this time.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zdy8l</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mxvm</id></website><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rwe-npower-and-eon-halt-nuclear-plant-development-7600017.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T09:51:57+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T12:05:36+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mweh8u</id><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rwe-npower-and-eon-halt-nuclear-plant-development-7600017.html#comment-480667055</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/akhyv</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
