Federal law trumps state laws so it doesn't matter what the state law is. It is the same thing as if Things were selling Heroin as both are now Schedule I drugs as labeled by the DEA. In the coming weeks there will be no mercy shown for these drug dealers who sell out of their "business". I am not an advocate of punishing  users as they are just  junkies who are victims of the drug dealers, it is just a sad situation for all involved except for the dealers who are profiting from crime. I only hope next they wipe out these so called "medical Dr's" who are getting our children, mothers, and fathers hooked on opiates.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6d3iim</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xt9i</id></website><link>http://www.starhq.com/2012/03/22/local-federal-law-enforcement-raid-head-shops/</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T18:00:52+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-24T01:11:45+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mijsf2</id><link>http://www.starhq.com/2012/03/22/local-federal-law-enforcement-raid-head-shops/#comment-474953796</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zyddl</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
