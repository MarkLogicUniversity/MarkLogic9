Mash had 20 lbs on Barnes and was a sophisticated ball handler and passer, neither of which are strong suits for Barnes.

Both were deadly jump shooters but Mash had more of a post game as well and would often fire his fade away on the low block. Barnes doesnt seem to have that in his arsenal and shots the majority of his jumpers from Spot ups or  the dribble.

The best comparison I've seen is Wally Szerbiak (sp - to lazy to look him up), a good complementary player who even made an allstar team one year but was Always limited by his inability to create his own shot.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z9pc3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnei</id></website><link>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/29/3137502.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T01:04:32+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T06:59:10+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3032c</id><link>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/29/3137502.html#comment-480366291</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzpba</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
