Forget Batman Beyond, it was at best tainted water fed to a fan base Thirsting for a decent film franchise reboot...that paid Off in spades when we got it. It was what it was and it was fine while it lasted...but unless Tim or (and this would nulify my statement and make me eat my own gizzum) Damian wore the suit, what would be the point?</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z10ve</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7d9s</id></website><link>http://tv.ign.com/articles/122/1221966p1.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:13:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T05:55:46+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3wt87</id><link>http://tv.ign.com/articles/122/1221966p1.html#comment-480298983</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zzykk</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
