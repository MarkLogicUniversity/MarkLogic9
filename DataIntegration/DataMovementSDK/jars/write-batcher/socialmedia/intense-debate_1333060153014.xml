I have to say, as someone who was a teenager in the 60s, I remember an awful lot of these looks.  The housecoats and the prints used in them - Spot on, including Megan's in the post-party clean up scene.  Big florals done in polyester.

I was thinking on Sunday night that Joan's wearing white gloves for her trip to the office (and seeing Megan's which I'd overlooked) seemed not quite right.  However, I have just remembered my summer as an intern/assistant at a Manpower recruiting office in My Old Home Town in 1969, and one of the components of the "Here's your Manpower Girl assignment kit" were little white gloves.  Only wrist length and only in polyester, but still.... white gloves.  (a pair of which, really beat up, are in my nightstand for use as nocturnal winter-hand-cream-insulators some 43 years on)
