"Culture means either something neutral or
positive."

"Culture" has many meanings, if you bothered to
look it out, that's not what cultural mean in this context. Call it
sociological behavior/mentality if it makes you feel any better.  

 

"It derives from religion."

I don't know how many times you have to hear it to get it
into your head:

1. Non-Muslims from southern countries do it as well, not
only Muslims.

2. There's nothing in Islam regarding honor killing.

How is that hard to understand? Seriously?

 

"If you think Iran having a nuclear bomb is not a
threat to Israel, you'd have to be insane."

Again, why do I have to repeat what I already very clearly
stated?:

1. Jews=/=Israel. Israel is a country with its own policies.
Some Jews are against Israeli’s policies, so you would know.

2. Read the WP article I posted earlier. No really, read it!
Not just read the title and come back to your "Heated" comment! 

 

Again, read what I wrote carefully before Acting like the
religious fanatics you claim you hate.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lgl7h</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ll7p</id></website><link>http://www.atheistmedia.com/2012/03/tell-truth-about-islam.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T20:25:33+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T16:53:11+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mssf4f</id><link>http://www.atheistmedia.com/2012/03/tell-truth-about-islam.html#comment-478537009</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8smdw</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
