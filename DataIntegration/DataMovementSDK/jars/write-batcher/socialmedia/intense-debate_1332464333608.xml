Littwin's official title in his contract was "Cityside" columnist.  He had drinks with Greg Moore last week, and basically told him that he couldn't be laid , because his contract would have allowed him to go back to his original position.  The way the Denver Post got around this was eliminating Chuck Murphy's role and in doing so was able to eliminate Littwin.  Ending Murphy's column was simply collateral damage.  Sleazy, creepy and Cold blooded.  Littwin's biggest mistake was reminding Greg Moore of this....it got the ball rolling for management to figure out how to get rid of Littwin.    If they had tried to lay Off Littwin without eliminating Murphy's column, Littwin could have walked into Singleton's office with his attorney and Greg Moore's balls on a platter.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6d9wdj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rpf5</id></website><link>http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2012/03/penny_parker_mike_littwin_denver_post_laid_off.php</link><postedTime>2012-03-21T12:39:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T14:07:12+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mp02tx</id><link>http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2012/03/penny_parker_mike_littwin_denver_post_laid_off.php#comment-473605689</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-21</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
