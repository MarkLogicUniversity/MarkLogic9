Oh, and "40 Below"!  I was listening to that the other day.

I had a lot of trouble with VH haters - actually, I won`t say haters, just non-appreciators - back in the day.  Can you imagine what it`s like when most people, if they`ve heard of VH at all, think of "Why Can`t This Be Love?"!!!  Actually, I guess that must be true in the US a bit too, just due to the ridiculous 28 year wait.  It`s gonna be great when we can look back in our old age on two generations of CVH, one with Wolfie, and one with Mike.    

Onto your important point though, about what VH to play to women who don`t know their music.  I should have tried something wonderful and accessible like "Little Guitars" and as you rightly say, "In A Simple Rhyme", sneak in a little "Drop Dead Legs"...then get her back to FW for another try!  If I`d played "Romeo Delight" or "Push..." then I`d have to do a little air-tapping for the intro of RD and the beginning of the great solo to Push, and that`s a guaranteed crash and Burn :)  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/doaj8v</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/fbtm</id></website><link>http://www.vhnd.com/2012/01/07/van-halen-live-2012-everybody-wants-some/</link><postedTime>2012-01-08T01:05:21+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-01-09T18:40:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/ef0yi8</id><link>http://www.vhnd.com/2012/01/07/van-halen-live-2012-everybody-wants-some/#comment-406433162</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-01-08</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
