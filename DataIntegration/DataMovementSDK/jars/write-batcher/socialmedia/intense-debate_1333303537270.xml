Our ministers are very good at sticking their or in then buggering Off!!!
Of the Total's rig catastrophe we hear (and see) very little in our British news! This was not so in our German newspapers.
In Weltkompakt's 28th March issue on the back page one read our British Minister for the Environment, Charles Hendry, attesting Total and the public authorities have a good crisis management. Yes, indeed, everyone has got in their escape boats and left it.
A second article two days later in the Weltkompakt described the leak is some 4km beneath the seabed (our UK news only showed the rig circa 300+ metres above the sea) and with a gas pressure of 1,100 bar (15,000+psi). An insurmountable problem? The newspaper also asked "with such an explosive gas-mixture then 'why' why is there a flame still Burning on the vent-pipe?"
Yes, excellent intelligent ministers - have we NOT!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67r51a</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9176237/Even-Im-starting-to-wonder-what-do-this-lot-know-about-anything.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:45:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T12:22:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwil9j</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9176237/Even-Im-starting-to-wonder-what-do-this-lot-know-about-anything.html#comment-481786371</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dlq6j</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
