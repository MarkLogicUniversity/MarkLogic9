Haney is "Spot on" with his comments on Tiger's putting.  And of course the same comments could apply to a lot of other guys as well. You just don't win the Masters three-jacking all over the place and I might add... without making lots of those putts 10' and under.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zao2h</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/9dd2</id></website><link>http://www.golfchannel.com/news/associated-press/haney-woods-putter-key-at-masters/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T04:22:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:47:21+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3x7z8</id><link>http://www.golfchannel.com/news/associated-press/haney-woods-putter-key-at-masters/#comment-479690282</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lwvs1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
