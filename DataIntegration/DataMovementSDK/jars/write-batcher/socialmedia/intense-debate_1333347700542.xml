By Ben Shapiro

â€œâ€¦â€¦Focus instead on the last part of Obama's statement:
"All of us have to do some soul-searching."

No, Mr. President. We don'tâ€¦â€¦

Obama implies that we all share some collective guilt for Trayvon's killing. And this is a favorite tactic of the left: We all created the "climate" that led Trayvon Martin to bang George Zimmerman's head on the pavement and led George Zimmerman to shoot Trayvon point blankâ€¦..

â€¦The "climate" argument allows for all sorts of
political maneuvering and situational exploitation.

When Communist Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated JFK,
liberals quickly blamed it on a supposed "climate of hate" â€” Jackie Kennedy even said she was disappointed that the assassin was a "silly little Communist.."

When nutcase Jared Loughner shot Gabby Giffords, the left quickly suggested that it was Overheated rhetoric that had led to the shooting.

When Islamists riot in the Middle East, President Obama
suggests that it's all our fault for backing Israel. Every bad  has a culture-wide root cause, and that root cause is almost invariably conservatism..

&lt;i&gt;President Obama's rhetorical flourish was far more than a rhetorical flourish. It was an active attempt to change the narrative, to magnify the Trayvon situation into an "America is racist, and you're part of it" meme.&lt;/i&gt;

Â What's the cure for that ill? Why, voting for every liberal line item, including the Obama re-election, of course!

Obama's words are an injustice. They are unjust to Martin and Zimmerman, who deserve a full factual inquiry rather than racial grandstanding. They are unjust to the Florida police, whose jobs are complicated by having to worry
about national unrest over this individual case. 

And most of all, they are unjust to Americans, who have nothing whatsoever to do with Martin's death â€” but whom Obama can milk for political  so long as he blames them at large for every bad Act under the sun.â€&#157;
