One time I found an ant on her and suddenly began panicking -- what if I suddenly found her covered in ants because she had milk on her chin and they were drawn to it?!  My friend who was there assured me that would never ever happen.  I had nightmares about starving babies.  Ahhhh.  Such a terrible time.  I think the sleep deprivation really compounds the problem.  Anyway, so many mothers make it look easy and it's  Comforting to hear that there are other people out there who have dealt with it! </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/66dp72</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/c8kw</id></website><link>http://dearbabyblog.com/post/19783532009</link><postedTime>2012-03-23T15:12:30+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:13:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3fwhs</id><link>http://dearbabyblog.com/post/19783532009#comment-479901524</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-23</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
