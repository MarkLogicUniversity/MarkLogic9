These are the Dog Days of March. Ham Weather reports 6,895 records in the last week – some towns 30 to 45 degrees warmer than average; -the-scale, freakishly warm.
  13,393 daily records for Heat since March 1 – 16 times more warm  
records than Cold records. The Scope, intensity and duration of this  
early Heat wave are historic and unprecedented.

 And yes, climate change is probably spiking our weather.

 “Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.” 129,404 weather records
 in one year? You can’t point to any one weather extreme and say “that’s
  climate change”. But a warmer atmosphere loads the dice, increasing 
the  potential for historic spikes in temperature and more frequent and 
 bizarre weather extremes. You can’t prove that any one of Barry Bond’s 
 762 home runs was sparked by (alleged) steroid use. But it did increase
  his “base state,” raising the overall odds of hitting a home run. A  
warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, more fuel for floods, while  
increased evaporation pushes other regions into drought.

Here’s what I suspect: the patient is running a slight Fever.  
Symptoms include violent tornado Sneezes, severe sniffles of flooding  
and raging rashes of jaw-dropping warmth. It’s 85 in March. What will  
July bring? It’s as if Mother Nature seized the weather remote, put  
America’s seasons on fast-forward, and turned the volume on extreme  
weather up to a deafening 10. This isn’t even close to being “normal”.   </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vx9om</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gfhw</id></website><link>http://newsok.com/article/3662770</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T16:28:41+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T03:13:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0f38c</id><link>http://newsok.com/article/3662770#comment-483259035</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/adlqv</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
