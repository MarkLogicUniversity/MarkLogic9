Â I told this several months ago and don't know if you saw it, but the night I went to see BD1 I came home and he was waiting for me in the dark swimming pool (it was November and he had Heated it to like 95 degrees without my knowledge). Â We fooled around in the pool for a while and eventually got up to the bedroom, but he had removed some of the slats holding up the mattress while I was gone (also without my knowledge) and when we were going at it like drunken monkeys the whole bed collapsed underneath us. Â We laughed our asses Off and when I woke up the next morning he had ripped apart a pillow and the whole bed was covered in feathers. Â It was awesome fun!</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z8ull</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/djgv</id></website><link>http://www.robsessedpattinson.com/2012/03/kristen-stewart-mentions-robert.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T05:17:08+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:15:47+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3jm1a</id><link>http://www.robsessedpattinson.com/2012/03/kristen-stewart-mentions-robert.html#comment-479960209</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
