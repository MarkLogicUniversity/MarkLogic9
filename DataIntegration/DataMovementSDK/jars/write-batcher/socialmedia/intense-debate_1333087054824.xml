They are not even on the case. But now take a look at Zimmerman. The law allows you to stand your ground and use deadly force but only as a last resort. You can't just get punched in the face and then shoot someone. It has to be a you-or-them situation. And Zimmerman just doesn't look like a guy who just got through fighting for his life.

As for "cleaning up" Zimmerman, he declined treatment, plus the job of a paramedic is to keep you alive, not to groom you. Besides, head wounds Bleed like the dickens. He'd be covered in blood that couldn't be cleaned Off right away, on his clothing. And the cops would be wearing gloves if his skin was at all broken.

Plus look at how the cops walk ahead of Zimmerman as they enter the building. This doesn't look like he's being escorted. It looks more like he's one of them.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zcxr4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:16:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:33:23+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3fcdq</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-479861155</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cnrpc</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
