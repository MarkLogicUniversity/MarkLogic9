Thanks for sharing. It's not  easy to admit where we fall short, so good for you for recognizing them and admitting them. The next thing you have to do is admit that the current way isn't working for you or your husband. Once you determine it isn't work, start thinking about what will work. Also, being honest about why you do what you do (the intentions and motives behind your action) is key. This what I had to do for myself, in a Heated moment, I had to take a second and ask myself questions like "why are you about to say or do something hurtful" and my answer would Always humble me. If I knew the sole reason for my doing a certain thing was to hurt my husband I had to start checking that behavior quick, fast and in a hurry. I know what my ultimate goal is for my family/marriage, I want to be happy. I have to contribute to that happiness, and let go that which does not honor that goal.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6motzg</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dz4b</id></website><link>http://blackandmarriedwithkids.com/2012/03/20/what-i-lost-when-i-got-married</link><postedTime>2012-03-20T10:45:21+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T00:17:35+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miyyfv</id><link>http://blackandmarriedwithkids.com/2012/03/20/what-i-lost-when-i-got-married#comment-474084196</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-20</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
