In December Off 2011, "The country exported 430,000 more barrels of gasoline a day than it 
imported in September, according to the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration. That is about twice the amount at the start of the year,
 and experts and industry insiders say the trend is here to stay."

The price of gasoline in not determined by price fairies.  If the oil companies can sell it for $8 a gallon in Europe, why should they sell it to local fools at half that?  Get over it.  As a consumer,  your job is to Bleed into the coffers of the corporations.  If you don't like it, quite buying from them.
