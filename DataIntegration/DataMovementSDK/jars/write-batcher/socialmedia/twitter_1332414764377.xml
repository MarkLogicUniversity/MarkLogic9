Naturally blogging and facebooking are one of the reliable and accurate sources not from the gravevine. 

I must commend on your hardworkÂ to make things happened. Realising the policiesÂ for the benefit of the people of Malaysia. Not on the principle of NATO (no action talk only). 

I  a lot moreÂ respect on youÂ and love MalaysiaÂ more each day when I discoveredÂ the fallacyÂ ofÂ  "Hujang emas di tempat orang, hujanÂ batu tempat sendiri"Â Â 

Malaysians are the  one, demandingÂ everything for the sky expecting the Government to deliver. I think it is timeÂ that we should let Malaysians toÂ work hard for their money instead ofÂ waiting for the windfall fromÂ the Government.

I am talking from my experience where I work now in Canada where the Government would not have any preference for any groups except the poor and the old. 

The government here does not provide any response to complaints but the long queue. Medical facilitiesÂ here areÂ at worse.Â If one is illed, he wishes aÂ serious ill in a emergency case than a commonÂ Cold with months long waitÂ for medical appointment. Yet they areÂ covered with medical insurance for in case of emergency.

Nobody careless of complaints wether in public or private sectors. Unless you areÂ instituting a legal proceeding. People here are lazy, work to rule and never willing to walkÂ extra mile to help anyone in need. 

I admire the administration of Government of Malaysia looking after the welfare of everyone. Medical and hospital facilities are one of the best in the world. Can not Imagine with RM1 you may get consultation and pharmacy provided.

Any complaints atÂ any moment, there are Government agencies would ever ready toÂ provide assistance to Resolve issues. People are friendly and hardworking to achieve the benefit for the organizations and the Government.

What now are we expecting further from the Government that is responsibile and caring?

Listening to and misleading by the irresponsible people are causing Malaysians to be divided.

YAB Dato' Seri, last but not least, pursue theÂ work objectively and preserance without fears andÂ favours is the event of the day.

Please keep it up. From farÂ at distance but close at heart.Â
