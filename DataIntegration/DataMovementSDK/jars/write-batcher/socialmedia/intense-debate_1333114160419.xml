It is now racist to try to fix the financial problems of our inner cities (look at Detroit), and if you do try, you might get Mr. Shabazz in your city threatening to Burn it down.  The Bounty on Zimmerman's head being passed on for comment, and the subsequent tomfoolery from this event is being encouraged by our President.

Class, when we add 2 and 2, what do we get?

It's that simple.

We know what's going on--you know it, and I know it.

Mr. Shabazz is no man of peace, and neither are his compatriots.  And by saying nothing, Mr. Obama has made sure to let us know he is not a man of peace as well...
