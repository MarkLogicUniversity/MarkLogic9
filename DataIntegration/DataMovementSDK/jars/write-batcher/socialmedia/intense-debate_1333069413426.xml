I really want a good, simple makeup remover that means no scrubbing, especially round my eyes! Recently I've been trying to simplify my skincare as my skin's been playing up, I like to use aqueous cream as a cleanser when massage it Off with a muslin cloth, it's moisturising but not greasy, really cheap and since doctors prescribe it I know it's not got any bad stuff in it. Even better, it can be used as a moisturiser on really Dry skin (although I try and avoid this as the fact that it's an emulsifier can wear away your skin over time -recent studies have shown-) If anyone's looking for a really cheap but very gentle cleanser, i really recommend going to your local chemist and picking a tub up :)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6l94h3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4ib9</id></website><link>http://www.fleurdeforce.com/articles/158/</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T16:46:01+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:40:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3x60l</id><link>http://www.fleurdeforce.com/articles/158/#comment-479684568</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rpsji</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
