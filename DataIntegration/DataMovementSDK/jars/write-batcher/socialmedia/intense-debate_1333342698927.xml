Family planning is so different for each couple. My husband and I are financially secure and all that and have a happy and secure relationship, but we aren't quite sure when we will have a baby. Something Always will come up that you can be like, well, let's just wait until this event happens, and THEN we'll start trying. This isn't very eloquent, but I'm trying to get it all out there. I've tried numerous birth control pills, and they all make me insane and stop my periods entirely, which leads to me buying a lot of pregnancy tests. I can't get an IUD. I'm allergic to latex (Ever had your clit swell up like a balloon? It. Is. SCARY!!!). I know there are other condoms- I've used them, and they are terrible and caused literal tears in my vagina that Bled- making sex very ugh. My periods are irregular, so charting is out. So I use a couple of these methods that aren't very pleasant, but sometimes we use the withdrawal method, with full knowledge that this isn't a very reliable method. We would still be super happy if we had a baby, we just aren't actively trying. Once we're done having kids, snip snip, he's getting a vasectomy. 

All of that said, I also had a miscarriage when my husband and I were dating and first slept together. It was terrible timing, as we were happy, but hadn't been together long enough to know if we would last. Plus, I was still in college and his career wasn't quite what it is now. BUT! I still cried when I found out I had a miscarriage, and I still missed the baby that could have been. I got over it, though, like the author. I agree with another commenter- it was super brave to put this article out there.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yx9co</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/twef</id></website><link>http://www.thefrisky.com/2012-03-22/girl-talk-i-had-a-miscarriage/</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T16:01:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-22T19:32:54+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mi59xc</id><link>http://www.thefrisky.com/2012-03-22/girl-talk-i-had-a-miscarriage/#comment-473872791</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z8a3f</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
