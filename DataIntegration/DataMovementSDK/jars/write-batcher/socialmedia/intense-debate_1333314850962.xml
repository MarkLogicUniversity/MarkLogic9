You are a sociopath and I suspect that the clinical type of your sociopathy is covetous psychopathy . Because you are being exposed for what you are and you are obviously not convincing anyone ( as atested by your negative ratings and my positive ones ), true to your type , you are now trying to claim some sort of false moral high ground while still trying to get in your insults . 
Churchhill said that &amp;quot; The only thing needed for evil to succeed , is for good men to stand by and do nothing &amp;quot;. I have  admired Churchill and I believe that&amp;#039;s true . That&amp;#039;s why I don&amp;#039;t stand by and do nothing . Sociopaths have so many blind Spots but I am Always surprised when sociopaths don&amp;#039;t understand that all they need to do to end something is to quit ( but then your ego normally won&amp;#039;t allow that , will it ? ) Now , all that being said , and I have my doubts that you can , if you want it to end ..... just end it . </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>article:intensedebate.com:297822:127130338</id><idPostId>127130338</idPostId><idBlogId>297822</idBlogId><idBlog><id>blog:intensedebate.com:297822</id><idBlogId>297822</idBlogId><link>http://www.gunsandammo.com</link><displayName>Guns &amp;amp; Ammo</displayName><objectType>blog</objectType></idBlog><link>http://www.gunsandammo.com/2012/03/27/creating-a-secure-zombie-proof-home/</link><displayName>How to Create a Secure, Zombie-Proof Home</displayName><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-01T21:12:59.000Z</postedTime><provider><link>http://im.wordpress.com:8008/comments.json</link><displayName>IntenseDebate</displayName><objectType>service</objectType></provider><object><id>comment:intensedebate.com:297822:127130338:329498007</id><link>http://www.gunsandammo.com/2012/03/27/creating-a-secure-zombie-proof-home/#IDComment329498007</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T21:12:59.000Z</postedTime><displayName>Comment on How to Create a Secure, Zombie-Proof Home by Alan_T</displayName><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><link>http://intensedebate.com/people/Alan_T</link><idEmailMd5>88a262a3a09e4ec518cd03cb47226797</idEmailMd5><displayName>Alan_T</displayName><objectType>person</objectType></actor><displayName>&lt;a href="http://intensedebate.com/people/Alan_T"&gt;Alan_T&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="http://www.gunsandammo.com/2012/03/27/creating-a-secure-zombie-proof-home/"&gt;How to Create a Secure, Zombie-Proof Home&lt;/a&gt;</displayName><platform>intense-debate</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
