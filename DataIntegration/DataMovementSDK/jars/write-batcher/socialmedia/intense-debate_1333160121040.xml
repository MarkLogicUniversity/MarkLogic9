She belongs in a better place than this evil Cold hearted world where everyone is separate-looking down at others as inferior according to how much money or what social class they are in-well it is the rich and powerful who have gotten that way by the evil they do for satan-the whole money system is satanic-the religion of satan is separation into classes of wealth and poverty-better and lower-in inequity. In God we are all one-loving one another as equals. Good people do not can not do the things that make one rich-God keeps his lambs poor and pure of heart-souls intact. He is taking many to heaven and at the same time the killers of his lambs are doing the evil killing-that will end them in eternal Hell and damnation-separated from God forever-and placed in Satans's place for those who have great pride in what a sytsem of inequity gives them-false pride-as superior scum.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zfizf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/cusm</id></website><link>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/03/29/woman-arrested-for-trespassing-in-hospital-dies-in-jail/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T00:05:42+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:18:19+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwm11z</id><link>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/03/29/woman-arrested-for-trespassing-in-hospital-dies-in-jail/#comment-480728750</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/hs7et</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
