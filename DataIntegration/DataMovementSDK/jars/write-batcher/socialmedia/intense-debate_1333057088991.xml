Here is why:1) Signed up for HBO and CIN, and it didn’t show up. Had to call and spend a good hour on the phone while they re-rout my call to the ‘correct department’.
2) The wireless TV box shuts  at least once every half hour, which requires you to reboot it and wait for it to load up again.
3)The wireless TV box disconnects from the wireless gateway frequently. You have to go and push a button on the gateway, then comeback and push a button on your wireless.
4)Some shows stutter in live TV, skipping a few seconds of signal.
5) It will take at least 10 days before they can come out and try to Resolve my problems.
6) For all you resolution freaks: It’s 1080i, A noticeable downgrade from my previous provider, DISHTV. The picture isn’t bad, but its not eye popping!
7) Their customer service is crude and barbaric. 
I just saved you the Headache I have had to suffer. And I’m not a TVholic. I just like to watch about 30mins a day, buts it not even worth it. Thanks AT&amp;T.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/abqp2l</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/57bc</id></website><link>http://jessicagottlieb.com/2010/01/att-uverse-review/</link><postedTime>2010-05-23T04:54:39+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-12-21T02:42:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/evkcjc</id><link>http://jessicagottlieb.com/2010/01/att-uverse-review/#comment-391122111</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2010-05-23</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
