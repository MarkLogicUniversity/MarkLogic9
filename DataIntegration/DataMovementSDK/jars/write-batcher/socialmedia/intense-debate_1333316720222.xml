Total visionary bullshit.

Faith-healing  on the faith of the healee, not the healor; thus may charlatans make miracles.  Prayer is self-talk, that's why it works.  You punish or reward yourself,  on how pleased or displeased you are with yourself, and blame it on God.  If prayer is self-talk, guess who God is -- and Always has been.  It's us.  We have a power to heal ourselves, but no one has taught us how to use it.  The High Priests of all denominations have claimed that power as theirs, coming directly from God.  They lie--for their own benefit.

Greta has it 100% right as far as i'm concerned.

BTW, my own book discussing the Reality behind Religion, will be out in May or June. It is called "It Was Too Soon Before."  My conclusion is that Jesus wasn't preaching Christianity, he was trying to teach Evolution (The Son of Man) "substance abuse," ("Shewbread" aka LSD, "Priestly Bread" made from rye infected with ergot) and homosexuality (men loving men.)  It was Peter who called him Christ and as a result, Christianity has misled the world for 2000 years.  Jesus' original message was right, (not necessarily what is reported in the offical Christian Bible but is turning up in other "Gospels" not included by Peter and the Big 4, and Paul, of course--who, incidentally, also had Epilepsy.  In those days they called it "The falling-down sickness) but it got mired down in the pig-pen of Judaism.  He was supposed to "fulfill" the prophets' predictions, but didn't. All he did, according to "Saint" Peter, was come back to life after being dead three days.  Then, instead of proclaiming himself King of the World and freeing the Jews from slavery, he floated up to Heaven in his burial clothes, promising to come back to "save" the world some other day. According to Christians, Jesus is still up there above the clouds, with his Dad (the magic old man with a white beard, sitting in his Golden Throne with angels flying around him), waiting until it is safe for a Messiah to come back down and send all the sinners to hell and turn the earth into Paradise for the righteous.  Oh, and it's Our Fault that he died in the first place.  Bullshit pure and simple.

Keep it up, Greta!  I for one agree with you!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67xzas</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ant8</id></website><link>http://www.alternet.org/story/154774/the_top_10_reasons_i_dont_believe_in_god/comments/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T04:08:44+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:42:20+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwszyh</id><link>http://www.alternet.org/story/154774/the_top_10_reasons_i_dont_believe_in_god/comments/#comment-481881649</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cn3d7</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
