On C-SPAN today, the Democrats, led by Congressman Jim Moran, 8th District of Virginia are fighting to block a $10,000,000.00 cut in funds from the NEA ($145,000,000.00 budget) who got a big boost in stimulus funds if you all recall, and was granted $50,000,000 in stimulus. Â That is now being challenged by Republicans. Â Personally, I find the NEA subject to cuts like any other program that is not but could certainly be supported by philanthropy if it is so essential. Â In the course of the last two years, we have learned of NEA (tax-payer funded, remember) funds have been distributed to projects that produced artistic, 'experimental'  (Cough) Â ' p o r n ' , and art that attacked Christianity and the desecrated the image of Christ. Â Furthermore, the most shocking transgression is/was, that the NEA, (or members of) who were more than happy to take stimulus funds (buy 's, I prefer) also took a meeting/calls from the White House who basically made it clear to a group of arts and/or representatives of NEA that they would like/expect their art to include 'work for the Obama' regime...political art, featuring the agenda of this Presidency.  This is documented in recorded phone calls.  Â So.... NEA touched the leper...Obama. Â  Like NPR and Family Planning, I say why should any taxpayer dollars be directed to this organization which has chosen to behave like a street w h o r e Â for the money?

One 'gentlewoman' (D) from California got up and began with "I'm the coolest grandmother in the world." Â Her point was that she lives in close proximity to a renowned, iconic arts organization. Â She continued to bleat about what a shame it would be if (the Smithsonian, Ca.) were forced to cut back services and programs that her grandchildren delight in. Â Well, dear, why don't you explain to your grandchildren that you instead chose a behemoth social program, ObamaCare. Â A crippling monstrosity. Â You also chose to direct hard earned taxpayer garnered stimulus funds in this sampling of  stupid wasteful  projects:

1.Â Monkeys Get High for Science (Winston-Salem, NC) - $144,541
2.Â Scientist Attempts to Create Joke Machine (Evanston, IL) - $712,883Â 
3. Research: Marketing Video Games to the Elderly (Raleigh, NC and Atlanta, GA) - $1.2 million
4. The Wheels on the Stimulus Go Round and Round (Clearfield, PA) - $1.4 million
5. Money for Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control to Ineligible Recipients - $2.8 million
6.Â NIH Spends Stimulus Money to Promote the Impact of Its Stimulus Projects (Silver Spring,
MD) - $363,760546
7.Â Whistle blower Alleges Fraud at Company Administering Child Care Funds (Kilgore, TX) -
$215 million
8.Â Health Insurance Grants go Unused (Washington, DC) - $142 million
9. Â Army Corps of Engineers Cleaning Up Their Act in West Virginia (Burnsville, WV) -Â $650,00010.Â 
10. Â Helping Drinkers Control Their Alcohol Consumption With Creative Labeling (San Diego,Â Ca.)Â 
$497,117

Explain to your grandchildren that you, a 'cool grandma', are also a big spending, big government creator and a  far left progressive, liberal Democrat that has no idea of how to budget for your country and YOUR skewed priorities are now coming home to roost with the chickens. Â And obviously, the millions above far exceed the $10,000,000.00 dollars being requested by the mean, nasty Republicans.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/e5nzir</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6bwl</id></website><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/deficit/2011/07/27/jerrold-nadler-d-we-don-t-have-deficit-problem</link><postedTime>2011-07-28T01:38:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2011-07-28T01:55:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/57a0to</id><link>http://nation.foxnews.com/deficit/2011/07/27/jerrold-nadler-d-we-don-t-have-deficit-problem#comment-267151600</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8nldh</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-07-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
