The Poetry of Barack Obama 
Following are two poems by Barack Obama that were published in the Spring 1981 issue of “Feast,” a 51-page student literary journal that described itself as "a semi-annual journal of short poetry and fiction collected from the Occidental College community.” The journal is no longer published, according to a college spokesman.

POP
Sitting in his seat, a seat broad and broken
In, sprinkled with ashes
Pop switches channels, takes another
Shot of Seagrams, neat, and asks
What to do with me, a green young man
Who fails to consider the 
Flim and flam of the world, since
Things have been easy for me; 
I stare hard at his face, a stare
That deflects  his brow; 
I’m sure he’s unaware of his
Dark, Watery eyes, that
Glance in different directions,
And his slow, unwelcome twitches,
Fail to pass.
I listen, nod,
Listen, open, till I cling to his pale, 
Beige T-shirt, yelling,
Yelling in his ears, that hang
With heavy lobes, but he’s still telling
His joke, so I ask why
He’s so unhappy, to which he replies...
But I don’t care anymore, cause
He took too damn long, and from
Under my seat, I pull out the 
Mirror I’ve been saving; I’m laughing, 
Laughing loud, the blood rushing from his face
To mine, as he grows small,
A Spot in my brain, something
That may be squeezed out, like a 
Watermelon seed between
Two fingers.
Pop takes another shot, neat,
Points out the same amber
Stain on his shorts that I’ve got on mine, and
Makes me smell his smell, coming
From me; he switches channels, recites an old poem
He wrote before his mother died,
Stands, , and asks
For a hug, as I shrink, my 
Arms barely Reaching around
His thick, oily neck, and his broad back; ’cause
I see my face, framed within
Pop’s black-framed glasses
And know he’s laughing too.
Obama’s purported father was 5’ 11’ and 165 lbs.  Frank Marshall Davis, a journalist, poet and author of “Sex Rebel:Black”(1968), was 6' 1'' tall and 230 lbs. In his pornographic autobiography Davis acknowledged that he was an admitted pedophile.  Davis purportedly “mentored” Obama in Honolulu, as per Wikipedia.  Is “Pop” filled with sexual innuendo of pedophilia?  Many believe so.  Does “Pop” merit some consideration in evaluating what President Obama’s intentions were in the “hot mike statements” made in Korea?  Perhaps.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rwjj8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/q0fi</id></website><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/26/obama-election-year-plea-to-russia-caught-on-live-mic/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:21:21+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:03:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mko8er</id><link>http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/26/obama-election-year-plea-to-russia-caught-on-live-mic/#comment-476640515</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/m88j3</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
