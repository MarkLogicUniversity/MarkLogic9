It's not surprising that Bill thought he was being put out to grass and that others thought he was being demoted.Â  What happened to him looks ust like what traditionally happens when a senior executive is being shunted out to make room for a favoured 'young buck'.

Changing this will be a long term task, it's about realigning expectations.Â  Communications could maybe help, but what can you say that hasn't bee said before but with tongue firmly in cheek to slip someone into a 'Special Projects' role?Â  Making it clear it's a temporary move would help a lot , e.g. "Bill will be running this task force for the next 6 months before returning to his substantive role, in the mean time Marion will be Acting Head of...", but that may not work for every situation, what if the task force is a 5 year, or longer, process?Â  It's a culture change, and a change of culture not just in one organisation but across many organisations, so like any culture change it will take a long time.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6ljsqz</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mft1</id></website><link>http://blogs.hbr.org/ashkenas/2012/03/your-career-needs-to-be-horizo.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-27T17:50:11+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T09:46:00+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwo751</id><link>http://blogs.hbr.org/ashkenas/2012/03/your-career-needs-to-be-horizo.html#comment-481696152</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a52c0</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-27</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
