Â That was in the 1990's.

Perhaps MA should copy CA. Â I think its better (naturally I'm gonna brag about it). Â I don't believe in it all, which shocked the courts when I told them that in my last divorce. Â By that time I had become the National Pres. of the NAF. Â I wouldn't give, or take, a dime from anyone that I'm not enjoying the benefit of their company. Â That includes child support. Â As far as I'm concerned, when a divorce occurs, relative to children that are a product of the marriage, whomever has custody has the responsibility for raising those kids, as if the other party had died. Â That's what I told the court in my 1st divorce when I got custody. Â They tried to order her to pay me CS. Â I told them I would publicly Burn it, if they ordered and she complied. Â No way! Â The entire country would be better Off if that approach was followed, IMHO.

That's my perspective. Â Getting married is about the same as forming a corporation. Â Is a failed corporation liable in perpetuity to it's stockholders? Â NOT!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/y005n3</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/09/opinion/hitner-alimony-overhaul-pro/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-09T12:59:11+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-11T01:02:32+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mbwyi6</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/09/opinion/hitner-alimony-overhaul-pro/index.html#comment-461813842</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/82fqb</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-09</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
