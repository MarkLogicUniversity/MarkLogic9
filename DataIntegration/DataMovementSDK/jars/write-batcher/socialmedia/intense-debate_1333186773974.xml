Same thing happens when I get a new foster dog that has been on a crappy food..Â  I go through a week to 3 weeks of Off an on stool issues and other symptoms like Watery eyes.Â  But then they balance out and can eat anything in the rotation plan I throw at them..Â  While in this transition/symptom phase I give them enzymes, probiotics and canned pumpkin which helps with the symptoms..

Animals and people eating poorer quality diets will often have "sludge" in the colon.Â  After starting probiotics (which Orijen has) the sludge is removed from the colon wall and has to come out somewhere..Â  Other times pup actually does have a problem with something in the food...Â  </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/mubwji</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ukja</id></website><link>http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/wellness-dog-food-super-5-mix-dry/</link><postedTime>2011-11-05T23:00:17+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T14:19:45+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwd3kr</id><link>http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/wellness-dog-food-super-5-mix-dry/#comment-480787319</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/rs74r</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-11-05</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
