It's no matter what color you are, if you murder another human being or commit a violent  towards another that is unjustified, you deserve the punishment! I am so sick of every issue concerning a blackÂ individual being about race. If you commit the crime, it's your fault! It's not the white man's fault or any other person. People exploit these issues and others run with it. These three creeps, if they are found guilty, deserve what they get. If jail were as it was 50 years ago people would think real hard about harming another.Â  The problem is when people shoot these individuals in the , the media exploits it, others run with it and the person who defended themselves fear imprisonment. If I had to guess these three sacks of crap probably have records a mile long. But reguardless, it's so sad to see a person, any person, stoop so low, to be so selfish, so Cold-hearted and emotionally numb to commit the Act of taking anothers life. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rouff</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dne0</id></website><link>http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/2012/03/26/1987656/columbus-police-3-charged-with.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T09:57:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:20:22+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mku7t0</id><link>http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/2012/03/26/1987656/columbus-police-3-charged-with.html#comment-476424503</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/d91tv</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
