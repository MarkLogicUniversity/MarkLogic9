And yeah, she was Cold, but given her lot in life and what she was willing to do for her sister and mom she's anything but heartless or unlikable. Boo hoo she didn't get googly eyes for the boy who liked her and was too distracted to see it by trying to SURVIVE before the games. If anything I feel like she's such a strong character she was actively fighting against some of the writing Collins was trying to give her.
