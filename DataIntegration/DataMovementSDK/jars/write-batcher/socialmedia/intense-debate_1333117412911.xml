Â The Sun may blast us with stuff, like proton storms and the like, but the production of such blasts usually corresponds with events on the Earth (and on the other planets). Â The Solar System as a whole is being  upon, and the Sun is merely the best barometer for when the activity goes up or down. Â For example, the increase in intensity of earthquakes began around the time that sunspot AR1429 began to Heat up - while it was on the other side of the Sun. Â Once the sunspot began belching material at the Earth, we were already in a condition of heightened activity, the which was probably exacerbated by the actual solar onslaught.

I do not know what is  on the Solar System, but it must be galactic in nature. Â In this respect, it's interesting to note that the "ribbon" observed by the IBEX crew, which is currently interpreted as an expression of the galactic magnetic field, changes dramatically on short timescales. Â The same goes for the Crab Nebula. Â Scientific progress  on thinking top-down, instead of bottom-up. Â The green movement, and also the larger portion of academics, tend to think bottom up, and thus miss what may be the actual causal functions. Â I'd recommend looking at some of Lyndon LaRouche's writings on how the principle of the "mass strike" relates to cosmic radiation, such as a 2010 paper called "Mapping the Cosmos!" which you can find here: Â http://larouchepac.com/node/13905

On your other questions, the typical sequence of events we've observed are as follows: Â First, NOAA's weather satellite, GOES-15, observes a spike in x-ray radiation from the Sun, which typically comes from the region of a sunspot (but not ). Â Other spacecraft, such as the SDO, would measure a corresponding spike in ultraviolet radiation. Â Next, within minutes we measure a rise in solar proton flux - "solar cosmic rays" - with GOES (but not ). Â At about the same time, we may find that high frequency radio broadcasts at high latitudes get scrambled. Â Next, between one and four days later, we may get hit by a coronal mass ejection. Â This is measured, first, by the ACE satellite (which is currently about to poop out, without immediate replacement) as an increase in speed and density of the solar wind, and as a sharp change in direction and intensity of the interplanetary magnetic field. Â On the ground, magnetometers measure changes in the local geomagnetic field. Â If it changes direction rapidly enough, then a geomagnetic storm has been initiated, which has the power to drive electric current through our aging infrastructure and blow out entire electric grids for months to years. Â Of course, sometimes a direct hit by a CME does very little (like those of early March), and sometimes very strong geomagnetic storms occur without evidence of a large CME impact. Â Also, sometimes we see flares without CMEs, sometimes CMEs without flares (as has been the rule for the past three years).

So, in short, all of those things could happen, or a combination of a few of them. Â The causal function, as before, is not well understood. Â What is clear, is that when the Sun starts  up, it's a good idea to look around the Solar System, and see which planets are also Acting up.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z81hj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/hiq1</id></website><link>http://larouchepac.com/node/22167</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T05:18:45+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T20:31:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3fab9</id><link>http://larouchepac.com/node/22167#comment-479859074</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/gbxcl</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
