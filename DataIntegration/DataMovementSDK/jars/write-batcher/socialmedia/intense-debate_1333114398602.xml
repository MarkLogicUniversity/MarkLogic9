I was obviously scared, stressed, and sad.  The books were my outlet.  They helped me take my mind Off of the sadness that kept me up at night.  My husband passed away a few months ago now, and I am reading more than ever!  It's my safety blanket, my way of coping, and certainly my outlet.  I don't know what it is, but when this tragedy hit my family, (we have a 5 year old too), I set some of my other books down and got hooked on the so-called "trashier" ones.  I'd like to say I don't care who knows, but honestly I do.  I can't help it.  :o)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6homh7</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/qpf2</id></website><link>http://theheroinesbookshelf.com/2012/03/28/book-shame/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T19:35:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T01:17:48+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ilv1</id><link>http://theheroinesbookshelf.com/2012/03/28/book-shame/#comment-480106392</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
