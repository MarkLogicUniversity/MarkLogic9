Similar to the beloved Tickle Me Elmo (a.k.a.T.M.X Elmo), this Elmo Live toy tickles if you touch his tummy, foot and back (sensors will be activated when you touch the right part of Elmo's body). He Moves, Talks, Dances, Tells jokes, and even Sneezes! When he tells stories or jokes, he actually moves his mouth in nearly perfectly sync with the voice. And you know what, he even Acts out during his story-telling. For instance, he moves his cute hands up to show he is shocked. If he reads to some part that's really funny, he laughs out which is really hilarious. This new Elmo Live doll is capable of so many life-like movements, that he looks like the real Elmo alive from the Sesame Street. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/g7rbav</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/v2qt</id></website><link>http://www.themusic-world.com/artist/60_ft_dolls/lyrics/no1_pure_alcohol</link><postedTime>2011-06-10T20:31:17+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:01:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3v9go</id><link>http://www.themusic-world.com/artist/60_ft_dolls/lyrics/no1_pure_alcohol#comment-479470960</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zza3k</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-06-10</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
