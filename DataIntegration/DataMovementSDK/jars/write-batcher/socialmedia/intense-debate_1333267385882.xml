But you know that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Washington PostÂ Declares Rush Limbaugh Boycott Nearly Over, Failed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;byÂ Noah RothmanÂ | 8:56 am, March 29th, 2012&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Â»The effort to boycott advertisers on theÂ Rush LimbaughÂ radio program appears to be drawing to a close, according to theÂ Washington Post. Limbaugh had sparked the ire of a number of progressive groups for his multi-day attacks onÂ Sandra FlukeÂ for advocating Congress mandate copay-less insurance coverage of birth control and contraceptives. On Wednesday, WaPoâ€™sÂ Paul FarhiÂ declared the boycott on Limbaughâ€™s advertisers was largely a failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
â€œThe dark clouds hanging over Rush Limbaugh appear to be lifting,â€&#157; writes Farhi. â€œOn Monday, the 600 or so radio stations that air Limbaughâ€™s program were told by his syndicator, Premiere Radio Networks, to resume running â€œbarterâ€&#157; ads during his program.â€&#157; Clear Channel, Premierâ€™s parent network, had previously suspended barter ads while Limbaugh was in the news.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The boycott was initially successful, forcing fewer than five of Limbaughâ€™s national advertisers to cease funding the program. However, boycott organizers who claimed that over 100 advertisers dropped Limbaughâ€™s program were stretching the truth as â€œsome of these companies werenâ€™t regular Limbaugh sponsors in the first place.â€&#157; Most of the advertisers who opted to drop their ads from Limbaughâ€™s program were only airing those Spots in regional markets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At the height of the controversy, Limbaugh lost two small syndicated stations in Western Massachusetts and Hawaii. All of the major markets that carry Limbaughâ€™s program opted to weather the storm â€“ now it seems the clouds are clearing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The organizers of the boycott effort are not done yet. The liberal group MoveOn org has organized a petition with SignOn org which asks for signatures to force Limbaughâ€™s program Off his 180 stations. But with interest in the month-old scandal waning, the likelihood of further success in the â€œStop Rushâ€&#157; is in doubt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
