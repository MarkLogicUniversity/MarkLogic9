 "But there are hideously ignorant, and yes, SPOILED poor people. People who are totally fine with working one day a week while their parents pay for everything, even though their parents are drowning in debt and about to foreclose. POOR SPOILED ignorant people. And they have no idea just how badly Off they actually are, because their lifegoals are for their bongs to be filled, and to have whatever shoes on their feet, and whatever fast food their moms bring down to the basements to eat". This is Spot-on. 
There are, of course, many people who are not lazy like this, but I see it so much, especially seeing as I live in Canada where welfare is very much a way of life for people.  I mean, you can get monthly disability benefits for being an alcoholic here, which just boggles the mind.  But that's another story.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r75tt</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/tdqu</id></website><link>http://www.xojane.com/issues/classwar-beverly-hills</link><postedTime>2012-03-25T17:59:05+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:34:15+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3te5j</id><link>http://www.xojane.com/issues/classwar-beverly-hills#comment-479491659</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zdeec</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-25</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
