Amun, aka Quetzalcoatl and being one of the various gods of winds, was displeased with the fingernail polish of our Panther so (being an Old Testament kinda guy) used a door as an instrument of guidance. This was after Nemesis tried to teach her a lesson for being a lawyer with a Toothache; apparently that counts as an Act of hubris, the primary of the seven deadly sins, one which I seem to commit at least on a weekly basis.

I sincerely hope she's keeping her toes up to standard, no telling who's in charge of infractions of those digits. The panoply of Old Time Religion is something I prefer not to trifle with.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6r099v</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ufye</id></website><link>http://algofighters.blogspot.com/2012/03/march-26-evening-thread.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T16:07:18+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T20:27:29+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkpuo6</id><link>http://algofighters.blogspot.com/2012/03/march-26-evening-thread.html#comment-476715178</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/51gp</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
