The media, which is accused of portraying the death of a young black kid of being a race crime though it may or may not have actually been one, is EXACTLY the same as a group of people who kicked your doors in at night, dragged you out, hung you and your children (but not before cutting Off your ears and fingers and passing them around), and Burning a large cross in your yard. 

Exact same thing.

Shut up, Coulter.   Strip yourself of all of your wacky biases and allegiances and open your eyes for the first time.  The world as it is and the world as you see it are not the same.  </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/676dy6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/mtxn</id></website><link>http://edit.hollywoodreporter.com/node/306357</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:01:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:22:57+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwzr7w</id><link>http://edit.hollywoodreporter.com/node/306357#comment-481038190</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6e6yd</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
