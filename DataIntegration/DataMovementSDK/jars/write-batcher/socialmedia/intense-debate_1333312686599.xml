Remember the Washington Post article right NOW before the Heat starts again and we get all wrapped up in the artificial deadlines.  Remember, I am referring to the article where the President and Boehner came to an agreement July 2011 on the budget and then overniight Obama changed his mind and blasted Republicans for not compromising?

I cannot prove that Obama has an outside trump card but we had a similar situation to that behavior with our Michigan Democratic Governor, Jennifer Granholm.  She would meet with legislators and come to an agreement and then change her mind when she talked to someone outside of the meeting on her cell phone.  At one point the committee refused to meet with her unless she turned Off her cell phone and stuck to her agreements in the meeting!  Someone else may be calling the shots when Obama consults with them.
