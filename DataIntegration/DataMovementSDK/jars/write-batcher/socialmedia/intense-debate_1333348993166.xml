So SUPPORTING the dream  without actually calling it amnesty is now a "hard-right position"? What does this reporter think a hard-left position would be? A blanket grant of U.S. citizenship to every single person in Central and South America? No, that would probably be a moderate, centrist position, in his twisted view. 

If Romney REALLY wants to balance out his main shortcoming as a candidate, he should nominate an actual REPUBLICAN for vp. That way there'd at least be one on the ticket. 

Alex Castellanos considers it a given that the moment the Mittster gets 1144 delegates, all the conservatives that he continues to royally pi$$  and take for granted are going to start spinning around, and when the smoke clears, they will emerge as FIERCE ROMNEY SUPPORTERS. 

DREAM ON! 

Pandering and playing identity politics will not win Romney a SINGLE Latino vote. And it will lose many of the votes that they arrogantly assume are "in the bag." Actually providing a contrast with his opponent would win votes. But I think it's probably too late even for that. Romney has permanently Burned his bridges with conservative voters, moreso even than McCain did. So I'm Glad they think my support is a given. Because I will most certainly be boycotting Romney this November. The problem is that we now have a candidate who refuses to believe that's even possible! </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vjknr</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/f047</id></website><link>http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/219407-romney-needs-to-pick-hispanic-running-mate-say-gop-strategists</link><postedTime>2012-04-01T21:51:24+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T06:42:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0jeol</id><link>http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/219407-romney-needs-to-pick-hispanic-running-mate-say-gop-strategists#comment-483318300</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-01</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
