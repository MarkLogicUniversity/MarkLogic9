This question has been going through my mind ever since I read on this site about how the Cowboys version of the 3-4 is in essence very similar to a 4-3 Under (believe it or not this idea hadÂ occurredÂ to me). This was due to Ware almost Always rushing, whilst Spencer will mainly play pass/run defence (Ware's assignment is pre defined whilst Spencer's is defined by the O). We line up 3-4 but change at the snap to essentially a 4-3. My question is this. Does this happen by design or because of the relative talents of Ware and Spencer? Spencer takes a lot of Heat for not being Ware, but is most of it justified?Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6vi5sc</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gz6n</id></website><link>http://www.cowboysnation.com/2012/04/bruce-irvin-i-met-with-dallas.html</link><postedTime>2012-04-02T00:38:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-04-02T07:03:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m0jr2j</id><link>http://www.cowboysnation.com/2012/04/bruce-irvin-i-met-with-dallas.html#comment-483323787</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z6443</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-04-02</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
