Polls in the Moscow Times show that at least 33% of the people are vocally committed Communists and party members, and are still quite a powerful presence in the govt. bureaucracy.  They did not simply Vanish from their entrenched positions when the Berlin Wall fell and the USSR performed a tactical breakup.  And Putin is a KGB man (FSB now, but the leopard does not change its Spots).

Also, every russian I interacted with on a regular basis, for example my landlady, my maid, my driver, my language instructor (this list goes on), all said that things were infinitely better for them under Communism.  Of course, they would think that since they are Muscovites.  Much like those living in The Capital in the new movie, The Hunger Games, Moscow (and St. Petersburg) was like a vampire, sucking the life from the surrounding provinces to sustain its utopian world view.  You recall, perhaps the Holodomor (death by starvation) imposed on the Ukraine back in the 1930's, where literally millions of people were systematically starved to death. Yeah,  people in Moscow had it pretty good on the backs of the Ukrainians (and the Ukrainians haven't forgotten).</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z5ld6</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6rx1</id></website><link>http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/53808931-82/obama-putin-russia-defense.html.csp</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T07:03:26+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:50:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3sfjn</id><link>http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/53808931-82/obama-putin-russia-defense.html.csp#comment-480216944</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/lr3zl</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
