- it's safe: you aren't likely to get blown  the coast path into the sea as it's a walled paved area Reached by road (Dodman Point at Lundy Bay is lovely but a bit iffy with a strong wind and when the grass is slippery)
- you can nip into the pub for a warm up in front of the fire with a pint of Tribute (it's West facing so you can see rainstorms approaching over the sea and dive into the pub just in time)</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/5r0tmn</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/hv0w</id></website><link>http://ilovecornwall.com/be-inspired-page/rainy-days/</link><postedTime>2011-03-24T13:36:48+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T04:56:23+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwfmla</id><link>http://ilovecornwall.com/be-inspired-page/rainy-days/#comment-481546081</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2011-03-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
