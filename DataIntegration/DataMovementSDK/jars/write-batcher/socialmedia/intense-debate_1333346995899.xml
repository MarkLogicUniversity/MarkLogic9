What about boy's immodesty? What about boys on Facebook? I have  felt that I competed with men and got the same kinds of jobs and earned the same range of income. This is the first time (and I grew up in the 40's and 50's when women were automatically consigned to the kitchen) that I have felt that women were actually being targeted. 

Even during the bra Burning   men were resentful but relatively submissive. Women after all are the source of the pleasure of many of them and they didn't forget it. Seems that men have forgotten a basic. 

I recall that some women in Africa cut their men Off until they got what they wanted, a few years ago. It could happen again. Hmmmm. No more sluts, guys....(I'm not aiming that at most of the men on this board because I haven't found that kind of behavior here except in a few isolated troll situations).
