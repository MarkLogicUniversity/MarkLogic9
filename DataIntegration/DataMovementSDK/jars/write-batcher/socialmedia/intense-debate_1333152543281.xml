Â I really don't. Â Where I live you have to take your hood Off before going in a store, and most everyone does. Â I swear though, a couple weeks ago I was in this head shop picking up some liquid nicotine for an e cig, anyway there was a black woman in the store about 65 years old with a hooded sweatshirt.

Â I thought that was pretty stupid.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z3b9t</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T07:25:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T11:32:14+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwgp7t</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-480641597</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ho8n5</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
