Two things--

1. I agree that much of today's advertising is still condescending to women, but was afraid the post would be too much of a downer with ALL negative ads. And, even with the T&amp;A ads and proliferation of feminine hygiene products out there, it is still a far cry from "get over your Morning sickness and cook me breakfast" or "If you'd just douche with Lysol, our marriage would be saved" attitude.

2. The people who really need to know this history are young women. When I gave this presentation at my Dem women's group, it was mostly middle-aged and older women, who all remembered what it was like in the "bad old days." But, there were a few young ones in attendance and they were totally fired up after seeing it. One, a twenty-something came up to me afterward and said she was eager to spread the word (and that she NEEDED her birth control and wasn't about to have a bunch of old men tell her she couldn't have it!)Â </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/678213</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/hxgv</id></website><link>http://politicalgates.blogspot.com/2012/03/one-more-reason-to-fight-right-wings.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T11:29:48+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T15:18:09+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mw6m3x</id><link>http://politicalgates.blogspot.com/2012/03/one-more-reason-to-fight-right-wings.html#comment-480847017</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/dzti4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
