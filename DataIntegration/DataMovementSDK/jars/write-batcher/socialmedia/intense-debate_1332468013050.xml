People lose their right to privacy when they choose to earn a living based on the image they sell to the public. And in a condition where a minority suffers unjustly, a celeb who sides with the majority is automatically committing an immoral Act (prior LDM analogy: JewsÂ supporting Hitler).

So if that celeb actually belongs with the minority while denying her affiliation, then she's at fault for sheer stupidity (another unforgivableÂ conditionÂ when you'reÂ a public personality) and has set herself up for outing. And it's not like she doesn't have options: retreat further into the closet, come out, or give up the public career - can't take the Heat, get outta the kitchen. Case in point: I recently had to get recloseted, because of the kind of job I got. Who'll care, I'm no image-peddler. And I'll re-out myself once I'm sureÂ I can get away again withÂ it.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yxjcm</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rpy0</id></website><link>http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/2012/03/tabloid_outing.php</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T16:02:47+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T00:56:49+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miyf0b</id><link>http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/2012/03/tabloid_outing.php#comment-474105298</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
