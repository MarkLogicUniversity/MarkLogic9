3.8/5 .. Reasons 

Computer cheats you out of obv wins
your teams CPU should match up to the opossite teams
CPU (it does not)
they get waaaayy to many rebounds ( because of so many missed shots ) and
obv def. Reb are much easier but they Always get more then nomal ORB's
shots from the 3 unless your completley open or extremly lucky .. Even mid range and it's so sad because the CPU can make 3's rain it almost feels as if the computer itself decides your shot not your release or traffic congestion ect..
It's to bad and I hope they can patch the shooting 
The only posative thing I can say is when you are on a
nice roll or hitting a few nice 3s it feels awsome but it's just too difficult especialy for
people who aren't as basketball intellegent
