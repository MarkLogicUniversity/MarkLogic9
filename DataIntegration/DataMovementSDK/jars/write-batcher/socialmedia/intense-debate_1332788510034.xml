I am a new owner of an  and I must say the  life is identical or better to that of my  2 (yes  consumption has increased, obviously but they supplemented the  as. They should have to  set the consumption of the display)


Now my usage may be a bit different than the average persons as I am indoors 93% of my day.. My display brightness is set on 1/3-1/2 strength.. The resolution is stunning..  And I have not had a Heat issue.  

Now I do not use my  normally while charging, but that maybe where the Heat issue comes into play.


Thirdly, I have been  the web Off and on over a 4g connection since 8 am... It's 3pm now and I am still at 65%. Now I haven't been pounding downloads..  Mostly we forums and news stations like drudge here..
