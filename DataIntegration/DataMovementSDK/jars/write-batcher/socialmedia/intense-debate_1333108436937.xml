You seriously think all those 'mysterious fires' downtown are nothing more than 'unfortunate accidents'? Â 

FUCK NO.

It's developers sick/tired of dealing with the bureaucracy/money being thrown propping up FACADES. Â The majority of those 'heritage' buildings are nothing more than EMPTY SHELLS. Â The 'heritage' building at yonge/dundas which Burnt down last year was a perfect example. Â Bricks were literally falling from it (could of killed pedestrians), and the inside of it was exposed showing NEW DRYWALL!

So what caused the fires?  The land value is significantly worth millions more than the old buildings standing there.  A condo could rake in 100-200 million profit.

You do the math.

If people want to preserve these buildings then it's quite simple: Â BUY THEM AND MAINTAIN THEM.

As the saying goes: Â Put up or SHUT UP.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6h052f</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rdvv</id></website><link>http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=185978</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T01:33:28+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:55:17+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3o0om</id><link>http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=185978#comment-480043303</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/c9nhn</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
