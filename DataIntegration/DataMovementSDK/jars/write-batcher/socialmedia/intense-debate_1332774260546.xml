They are such an easy read, primitive man at his finest. Stop coddling these cavemen, they have no value of life for even their own people. They will tear their own heads  to kill us if we Burn their silly little prayer book, but if we kill them by the truckload they will shut their filthy little mud licking mouths and conform. Its time we take a lesson from their own Caliphs and Dictators and Kings and junta's... there is only one way to deal with these people. Like it or not, Bales and a lot of other soldiers know it, he was just one willing to Act. We all should be so bold.</body><verb>delete</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rsf6l</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/world/asia/pakistan-foreign-minister-interview/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T13:41:19+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T14:14:44+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkul4a</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/world/asia/pakistan-foreign-minister-interview/index.html#comment-476420617</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a64s2</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>killed</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
