If Zimmerman really got nailed hard in the nose his shirt would have been covered in blood and he should of had at least one bIack eye.  Especially if after he got punch they started wrestling on the ground with a nose gushing blood, and then he put the gun against the boys chest and fired which didn't get any blood on him?

Zimmerman's story is crumbling like a sand castle at high Tide. </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zaa3b</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/yjmx</id></website><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/28/police-video-trayvon-martins-killer-smoking-gun-lawyer-says/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T03:38:16+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T19:14:19+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ul5y</id><link>http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/28/police-video-trayvon-martins-killer-smoking-gun-lawyer-says/#comment-479779353</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/djvee</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
