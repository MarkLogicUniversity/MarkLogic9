The issue here isn't really racism out about hatred for another race but how stereotyping and profiling can yield results like these.  The stand your ground law doesn't really give someone the right of self defense because every state has laws that allow self defense, but rather gives people the right to Act first based on perception rather than try to use reason. Martin had as much right to defend himself under SYG as much as Zimmerman, but wasn't packing Heat.  I've been profiled before in a gated community but by a true authoritative person like a security guard or cop, not a self appointed neighborhood watchman packing Heat pretending to be super cop.
