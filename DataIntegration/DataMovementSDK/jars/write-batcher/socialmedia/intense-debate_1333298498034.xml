     Bloody hell, mate - I've lost weight.  What with the Heat and Kang Ping chasing me round the house, my teeth don't fit any more.  Will you transfer some money from the rank account into mine?  .  Kang Ping knows a dentist who'll make me a new set of dentures, cheap if I pay cash, so she's gone to book an appointment.  He wanted paying up front so she's took all my baht with her.

     It's not that she doesn't love my gums, mate; she does.  Unlike English girls who complain at the drop of a hat, she likes some of the old sloppy.  She runs round the bed a bit faster and it's a lark trying to catch her.  Wet and warm, mate.  That's what it's all about.

     A chap down the road says there's a new bar opening in Phuket next week.  As soon as the money comes through, I'm Off to check it out.

     How's the weather doing in Blighty?  Ha ha.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hrzk1</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ms5w</id></website><link>http://my.telegraph.co.uk/theshortstoryclub/louiseatmyt/205/a-postcard-from/</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T11:40:29+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T10:55:00+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwpdpa</id><link>http://my.telegraph.co.uk/theshortstoryclub/louiseatmyt/205/a-postcard-from/#comment-481734613</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/luqap</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
