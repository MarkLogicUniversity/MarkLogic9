I am the most conservative man on the planet, not that that has anything to do with this, but Zimmerman needs to be dealt with in the same fashion as all Cold blooded killers.  Death penalty!  I Always suspect "wanna be" cops that didn't cut the mustard when they come up in situations like this.  Zimmerman is a clown and a failure, who though he could make himself a hero with a kid that turned out to be completely innocent.  Death penalty!</body><verb>delete</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6rwjhy</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/4847</id></website><link>http://www.therightscoop.com/breaking-police-zimmerman-says-trayvon-decked-him-with-one-blow-then-began-hammering-his-head/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T15:20:50+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:02:05+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mkf3mf</id><link>http://www.therightscoop.com/breaking-police-zimmerman-says-trayvon-decked-him-with-one-blow-then-began-hammering-his-head/#comment-476540773</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zr6ix</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>flagged</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>killed</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
