Â during the Cold war we put dictators into power who would fight communism. Â all of those dictators were a lesser evil than communist rule. Â today we have to mop up but compared to how it was pre 1991 (the world was a button click away from a nuclear winter) it is a MUCH safer world. Â i would rather we have iran and iraq and a few other dictators we can bomb than USSR which the west could never take on militarily without ending the world. Â its childish how myopic you are.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zzol8</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/h63b</id></website><link>http://www.tomwoods.com/blog/iranians-and-youtube/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:24:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T14:47:53+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwyqoz</id><link>http://www.tomwoods.com/blog/iranians-and-youtube/#comment-480815726</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
