Dogs being hung,  setting dogs on fire.  It makes you wonder why anybody would get their dog groomed at all.
That being said, most groomers love animals and would never hurt one if they could help it.
Like you, I have had to explain the differences between  and dont own a Dryer with Heat. I have the same kind as you. Hang on the cage and just warm air from the motor. No Heat added. Nowdays if you use anything else, your just asking for an accident of some kind.
