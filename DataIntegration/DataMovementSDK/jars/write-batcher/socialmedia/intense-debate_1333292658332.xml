its just a bit of a weblog.
you attach far too much importance to to this stuff.
how this works is, you see a controversial looking headline in 'news now' or whatever, its controversial because the writer wants you to follow the link to the site. so you follow the link to the site and read the non-story and the website receives advertising revenue because you've visited the site.
that's how people make money from the internet. so its in everyone's interest to write lots and lots of bullshit that will get mug punters reading and arguing amongst themselves.
reality isn't a non-story on a website it is something completely different.
these questions aren't innocent enquiries, they are deliberate attempts to wind up the Â interviewee. e.g. everyone thinks they know best about sterling and that he should be first team selection every week and if he isn't it means kenny is a fool etc etc etc yawn, so the bored journo has a little pick, like picking at a little scab to see if it Bleeds a bit. its totally transparent, so kenny gets irritated and fucks him Off. that's life when you're not a very good journalist, get over it.Â 
sorry to deconstruct it all for you, but there you go.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zvmap</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/llo1</id></website><link>http://www.offthepost.info/blog/2012/03/liverpool-kenny-dalglish-in-pointlessly-narky-press-conference-shocker/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T16:26:15+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T08:45:46+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwj11s</id><link>http://www.offthepost.info/blog/2012/03/liverpool-kenny-dalglish-in-pointlessly-narky-press-conference-shocker/#comment-481661888</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
