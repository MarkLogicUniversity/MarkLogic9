Ok, the first one, Akira Himewka (how do you spell that??) put it into the Manga when you come out of the temple of Time. as an adult, it shows Link helping out a soldier. Maybe that was a little  that the author noticed, and put in there.Â 

2. really? Hm...*starts making theories*

3. never played the game, but that is cool

4. "Eagle...."Lion"...oh wiat....SECOND quest mode....oops :P

5. Oh yeah...Chuggaaconroy pointed that out in his Let's Play.Â 

6. Never used the Tingle Tuner, XD. but that's coooolÂ 

7. I Always suspected that, but questioned it because Link talked. AH-HA!!! LINK KNOWS HOW TO TALK!!!! *party time*

8. I thought the Keaton Mask was a mix between Pikachu and Tails XDÂ 

9. ...that....I'm not trying that...the game isn't epic without "It's Dangerous to go alone! Take this!!"

10. Yeah I actually knew that. Wikipedia does say how Miyamoto was influenced. So, "Princess Zelda was named after Zelda Fitzgerald, Zelda Williams was named after Princess Zelda, therefore Zelda Williams was named after Zelda Fitzgerald." XD

very nice! Some of the things I knew, some I didn't because i didn't play the games. Even if I did play them, I probably wouldn't notice! XD I'm too busy killing Moblins!!!Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67ixrm</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/fw87</id></website><link>http://www.zeldadungeon.net/2012/03/10-legend-of-zelda-facts-you-may-have-missed-out-on/</link><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:14:49+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:28:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwsevs</id><link>http://www.zeldadungeon.net/2012/03/10-legend-of-zelda-facts-you-may-have-missed-out-on/#comment-481871552</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-31</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
