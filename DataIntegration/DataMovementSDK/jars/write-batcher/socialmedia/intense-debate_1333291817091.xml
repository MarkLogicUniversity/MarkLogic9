Last weeks episode, the project manager should have gone because she had no idea at all.
This weeks task, all 3 should have gone (what a total .... up!) That Jenna, well her accent would drive me up the wall for a start, I can see her bitching and moaning all the way, it's never going to be her fault is it? (get rid quick!).
As for the products the teams came up with, I just shook my head (bin them quick if you excuse the pun).
Look on the bright side.... it can only get better can't it? it's early days yet, looking forward to next week, hugely entertaining and how not to proceed in business.
P.S. The biggest laugh comes at the end when Lord Alan Sugar has to Cough up Â£250,000 to one of this lot. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zdl5d</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/6jmh</id></website><link>http://www.btlife.bt.com/entertainment/the-apprentice-designed-to-fail/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T09:56:43+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T12:52:38+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3vbda</id><link>http://www.btlife.bt.com/entertainment/the-apprentice-designed-to-fail/#comment-479465857</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
