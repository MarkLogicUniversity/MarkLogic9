The guy's decidedly both less popular &amp; more unpopular than McCain was with the base in 2008, &amp; the base didn't care for McCain. In almost every state primary, &amp; definitely overall, the GOP primary contest is failing to beat enthusiasm numbers going all the way back to Gerald Ford. There's never been a flip-flopper of such Herculean prodigy as Romney, &amp; he's setting a pace for telling nationally-covered lies about the incumbent that's going to break the all-time previous record before the summer even arrives; the only thing worse would be if he belonged to a religious cult, or if he was fatally compromised from credibly opposing the incumbent on some huge social issue (like, I dunno, health care insurance). Other than the usual outliers that  arise in polling to the double-margin (A plus/minus of 5% nineteen times in twenty in fact yields higher than a 1 in 20 ratio of outliers - quite apart from some pollsters *Cough* Rasmussen *Cough* focussing on either registered or likely voters 8 months in advance of an election, using push polling questions &amp; sticking to landlines only). Plus he's right in there while his party apparatus is all it can to turn Off women, Hispanics &amp; just about every other minority that they don't think wants Iran bombed, the working class, youth, students, the unemployed, the educated, &amp; we all know they'll get around to just about every other demographic conceivable by the time the general election gets under way.
