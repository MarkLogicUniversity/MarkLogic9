Desmond and Espinosa need to form a strong infield comboÂ like Rollins and Utley. Zimmerman should shine and I am expecting more from Werth (aren't we all). I don't mind Morse on the DL as he seems to get a slow start. Weak positions are 1B and CF (at least until Harper appears). 

Pitching will carry us - I can't imagine Strasburg, Zimmermann, and Gonzales all having bad years (Jackson will eat innings, but I don't expect a lot). As I stated before, I think Lannan will thrive as a 4th or 5th starter - I am not Too hot on Wang (injuries). 

Phillies and Braves are on their way down (Mets have owner problems and will be bad). Miami could be really good or bad - too many variables.
