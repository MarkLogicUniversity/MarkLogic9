I was a little skeptical because I don't usually read teen novels, but it looked interesting. I absolutely adored it and went through a roller foster of emotions with April, I feel like she told my story to a T from 15 to 18. Everything. Haha. Even about hating Mar. 29.. I hate Oct. 27 and the days that follow my birthday for dissimilar reasons. I also know what its like to be 16 and go from a perfect, clean, strict home to a unsupervised party Spot while being given generous amounts of money at my own irresponsible disposal. You live, and sometimes the learn the hard way, that is where the heart is.

I'm getting Off subject though. I would definitely recommend this book, as an easy read, very funny, and touching.
