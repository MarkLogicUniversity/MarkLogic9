Hillary is popular because she's serving as SOS, a position that, by law, forbids her from being involved in politics. That'll change the minute she gets back into politics.
2.	Biden is not as high-profile or as well-known as Hillary but that is no independent data that suggests he's unpopular.
3.	If Obama drops Biden it would cause a backlash because he would be viewed as (a) disloyal and (b) desperate.
4.	It also wouldn't change his vote total. PUMAs have spent 4 years hating Obama. If they didn't forgive him for giving Hillary the top Spot in the administration, they won't vote for him if she's Veep.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67co9p</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ai6</id></website><link>http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/03/30/biden_never_wanted_a_real_job.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:02:57+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:36:24+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwtg3v</id><link>http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/03/30/biden_never_wanted_a_real_job.html#comment-481171012</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ap70</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
