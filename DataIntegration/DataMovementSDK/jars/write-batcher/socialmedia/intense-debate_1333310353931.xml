Trayvon was talking to his girlfriend on his cell phone when George Zimmerman took confronted Trayvon, pushed Trayvon to the ground, took out his gun and pointed it Trayvon.Â Trayvon begin to yellÂ for help. And while Trayvon was yelling for help George shot Trayvon to death in Cold blood. If you don't believe me go and talk to George buddy to buddy. I have Always run from a fight. However, sometimes we are put in a predicament where we are pursued and cornered and can't defend ourselves.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67dyj4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/egg0</id></website><link>http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/03/30/afl-cio_conservative_right-wing_policies_to_blame_for_trayvons_death-comments.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T16:30:20+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T14:01:25+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwkjyk</id><link>http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/03/30/afl-cio_conservative_right-wing_policies_to_blame_for_trayvons_death-comments.html#comment-481851859</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z790j</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
