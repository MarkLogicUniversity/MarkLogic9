With that said I don't see San Jose resigning him because even before he was injured he was a healthy scratch. I know it's a long shot but if he hits the market this summer and Hejduk retires I wouldn't mind bringing back TJ to fill Dukes Spot, but I don't really see that happening if Sacco is still here.Â </body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6lc2qe</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5euq</id></website><link>http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2012/03/26/tj-galiardi-video-interview-san-jose/10181/</link><postedTime>2012-03-26T18:40:07+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T19:01:27+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mko27m</id><link>http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2012/03/26/tj-galiardi-video-interview-san-jose/10181/#comment-476638243</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-26</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
