CRONY CAPITALISM KEEPS BLOWING IN THE WIND



 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 

 
 
You would think crony
capitalists would try to keep a low profile after Congressional hearings released
a bombshell document Friday demonstrating that the ultimate Washington insider,
Jon Corzine, former New Jersey Governor and Chairman of Goldman Sachs, appears
to have ordered the looting of hundreds of millions of dollars from customers
at commodity broker, MF Global.Â  But after only a weekend of contrived outrage,
our elected leader seem to have returned to business as usual with a bipartisan
group of Senators, including Mark Udall (D-CO), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Chuck
Grassley (R-Iowa),  Brown (R-MA) and Dean Heller (R-Nevada) introducing legislation
to extend for another two years the subsidies for wind power labeled deceptively
as â€œThe American Energy and Job Promotion .â€&#157; Â The real message coming from the U.S. Congress
to taxpayers is: â€œwe need either less
corruption or more chances to participate in it.â€&#157; 


Windmills have
been around for hundreds of years to lift well water and grind grain, but the father
of the recent renewable energy scam is none other than Kenneth Lay, the
infamous former CEO of Enron. Â In January 1997, Enron acquired
Zond Corporation of California, the largest developer of wind-powered
electricity at the time. Â Enron then lobbied
the State of Texas to enact a broad electricity restructuring bill with a â€œrenewable
portfolio standardâ€&#157; that mandated private electric utilities buy a minimum
2,000 mega-watts qualifying renewable energy by 2009 and 10,000 mega-watts by
2025.Â  Enron also lobbied Congress to successfully amend Title XXII of the
Energy Policy  of 1992 to direct the federal government to authorize tax
incentives for renewable wind energy technologies.Â  Â 


Â 


Mr. Lay's wheeling and
dealing eventually drove the Enron leveraged empire into bankruptcy
court four years later.Â  His scams cost investors $10 billion dollars
and over 20,000 employees lost their jobs and retirement benefits in the largest
bankruptcy in American history.Â  Mr. Lay died
prior to facing a possible life sentence for his crimes, but Enronâ€™s crony tax
credits, mandates, and regulations did not die with him. Â In May of 2002, General
Electric acquired Enron Wind Systems and renamed it GE Wind Energy.




GEâ€™s corporate
motto is â€œImaginationâ€&#157;, but it was lobbying muscle that drove wind power.Â  GEâ€™s $23 million lobbying in 2005 was
rewarded with Congressional passage of the Energy Policy  of 2005 that
provided new tax incentives and loan guarantees for renewable energy.Â  As GE lobbying rose to $26 million in 2009, Congress
amended Section 406, the
Energy Policy  of 2005 authorizes loan guarantees to wind power as an â€œinnovative
technology that avoid greenhouse gases.â€&#157;Â  In 2010, GE lobbying
soared to $39 million
as the American
Recovery and Reinvestment  of 2009 spiked Congressional funding to $27.2
billion in grants for renewable energy.





 



Wind power has so much in the
way of accelerated depreciation tax break, production tax credits, and renewable
energy credits that GE has been able to recoup its capital investments within a
few years. Â The concept of actually
selling power is far down the list of priorities for wind power.Â  Electricity usage peaks in the Cold winter
and the hot summer, yet wind tends to blow the hardest in the low usage spring
and fall.Â  Consequently, electric
utilities must traditionally have fuel power plants ready at all times to cover
100% of electricity demand.Â  But under
law, if wind turbines do begin spinning the utilities are required to pay
approximately twice the going rate for any wind power that is transmitted to
their power grid.Â  


Â 


A good example of the
economic silliness of â€œwind farmingâ€&#157; takes place along the Columbia River Gorge
where there are a high number of wind turbines.Â 
The local electrical operator is Bonneville Power Authority (BPA).Â  Last year, BPA had to shut down the wind farms
for nearly 200 hours over 38 days.Â  By
law, Bonneville is required to compensate wind companies for half their lost
revenue. Â This yearâ€™s rebate bill could
 up to $50 million a year.


Â 


The
extension of the crony renewable energy subsidies were originally buried deep
in the legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline, but the Senate
rejected the measure on a largely party-line vote.Â  According to the U.S. Energy Information
Agency statistics, wind energy subsidies exceeded the subsidies of all other
conventional sources of electricity, combined.Â  The Keystone XL pipeline bill failed because
it would have bought cheap and abundant power to most Americans.Â  The American Energy and Job Promotion Act seems
to be headed for easy passage, because it brings abundant amounts of subsidies
to GE and other huge multi-national insiders.Â
