This is definitely going in the wrong direction.  This is a fabulous building with a fabulous location.  What a shame to see it go to people who don't deserve it.  Its just like the 3 halfway houses on Courthouse Square.  I want to live on Courthouse Square, but I can't afford it.  Apparently if I break the law, then apparently I have a shot.  And.. shame on the gentlemen who makes money Off of these people.  Not only he is taken advantage of those who are less fortunate, he is also completely disrespecting the people of Scranton who are trying to make downtown a nice place.    The Jessup Incubator project should switch Spots with this project.  The people who make things happen in this city have everything ALL WRONG.  So Frustrating!</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hmqot</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/d5sf</id></website><link>http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/halfway-house-proposed-for-vacant-factory-in-scranton-1.1291757?localLinksEnabled=false</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T08:23:58+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-28T11:30:23+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/msj2ly</id><link>http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/halfway-house-proposed-for-vacant-factory-in-scranton-1.1291757?localLinksEnabled=false#comment-478271097</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8a3h4</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
