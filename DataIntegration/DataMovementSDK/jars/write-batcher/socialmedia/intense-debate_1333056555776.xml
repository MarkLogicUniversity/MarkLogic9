Exerpt from Open letter written to the CFTC  --November 2011, yet, there still has been no progress on the implementation of the Dodds/Frank  - and the oil speculation.  Instead the Speculators such as Koch Brothers, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are still driving up the prices. 

The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) recently estimated that oil speculation alone will result in $600 in additional expenditures for the average American household in 2011. This money is going into speculators pockets and not being spent on other goods and services, which is therefore detrimental to both consumers and businesses with whom they are unable to spend. Many others including specifically but not exclusively Exxon Mobil, Goldman Sachs, and the Petroleum Marketers Association of America agree that increase in oil prices is due to speculation.

We are concerned that the recently approved limits of 25% for a single firm in Spot-month and 125% in cash-settled transactions are not extensive enough to  and put an end to the speculation that is currently driving up the price of oil and other commodities. The Commission is given the authority to implement positions, and in fact is mandated to do so in Sections 4a(a)(2)(B) and 4a(a)(3) of the . These sections charge the Commission with setting â€œSpot-month, single-month and all-months-combined limits for DCM [Designated Contract Market] futures and option contracts on exempt and agricultural commodities within 180 and 270 daysâ€&#157; of the enactment of Dodd-Frank, which occurred on July 21, 2010. Both of those windows have passed, and yet the positions are not yet being enforced.

In order to prevent needless and harmful speculation resulting in financial turmoil for so many US citizens, we urge the Commission to adopt strict position limits that fully comply with spirit and letter of the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, to define and propose new rules for the following:

1) Increase transparency by defining speculators in two categories:
â€¢ End users (â€œbona fide hedgersâ€&#157;) such as farmers, airlines and people;
â€¢ Financial institutions involved in speculation only; these organizations should be required to register with CFTC.

2) Immediately establish position limits on crude oil, Heating, oil, gasoline that would prevent any one speculator from controlling more than 5% of the physical market in the Spot month and 5% of open interest in the out-months.

We look forward to the CFTCâ€™s further actions in these regards.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zln55</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/rvx5</id></website><link>http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/29/markets/stocks/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T13:45:48+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T14:45:59+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m34dw3</id><link>http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/29/markets/stocks/#comment-479541993</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/a7qz8</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
