You blood suckers are Bleeding the tax revenues of the city. Get a job, get  welfare, get  the sofa, and look after yourself. I'm tired of working hard, only to pay taxes in the 50% rangeÂ  for a bunch of couch potatoes who are to lazy to get out there. There are lots of jobs, and if it doesn't pay well, get two jobs. If you would have stayed at home, Off the drugs and booze, and went to school, you could have had a good job. It's all in your up-bringing. Lazy worthless parents produce the same.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6yi3cx</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/7m2k</id></website><link>http://www.ottawasun.com/2012/03/22/protesters-want-watson-to-deal-with-poverty</link><postedTime>2012-03-22T23:50:59+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-23T01:21:31+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/miy0w5</id><link>http://www.ottawasun.com/2012/03/22/protesters-want-watson-to-deal-with-poverty#comment-474118204</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/y8ty3</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-22</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
