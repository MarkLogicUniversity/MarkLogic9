Let just say slagging  for kenny to go is frankly kneejerk ...more jerk than knee in your case.!!!

The football decision accepts we have screwed up again its one more ear to add to the 22 previous years that KK had nothing to do with.Â  He deserves as much a go as any of the previous managers bar RH. I just didn't like him there is a fine balance between beign a bad manager and a laughing stock.Â  Mclaren had a great rep at manuire thenturned into a joke...wally with the brolly. RH was going that way fast.Â  Thankfully KK is to well respected for that to happy why? He has put so much into this club and the game he is having a bad moment.Â  Yes we may need to find another manager but talent is not that easy to Spot Carrol is a case in point grass is Always greener aint it????
