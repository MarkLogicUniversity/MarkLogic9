i dont think you derserve the holy shitstorm you endured from the locals, quite honestly i thought you were the perfect example of what a local should be. respectful, and you let the vibe in the water dictate your reaction to the crowd. we had no choice but to show you the ultimate respect after you greated us with smiles and handshakes. 
 
that day was an abnormal convergance to be sure, probably wont ever happen again, but i want to thankyou for treating us like fellow south africans and not a bunch of brazillians...hahaha 
 
i have more respect for your Spot now, and will treat it accordingly. i believe in localism, but only when the situation dictates it. if out of towners are Acting like pigs by all means bring the heat. 
 
we live in country with way more waves than surfers, we need to treat each with respect, and share on the rare occasion when we get the chance too. there were at least 3 river mouths within 10 minutes that were firing that day, with nobody out.
