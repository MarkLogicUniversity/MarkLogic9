(S11,)  If this sacred proviso is to be removed, then we will decend into more &amp; more black market transactions, &amp; more tax avoidance, &amp; more under the table activities &amp; thus less tax receipts.

Whereas to day, the ATO has only to cope with legally accepted  Tax minimisation planning, that has minimised (theoritically) the olden days of tax cheating. Cashies will  exist &amp; would be impossible to fully eradicate, as there are  those who can circumvent the tax Act.  

The evaded tax of those early  days will usually be recovered in the GST, that soon successfully followed those early days of tax evasion-or avoidance-which ever was the target.

To attempt to attack the current situation will see more &amp; more -albieit risky-attempts -&amp; successes- to avoid &amp;/or evade more tax "planning" . The challenges involved will be a real Headache to ATO  

There is a time to realise that there are as many devious minds outside the ATO as there is among those of public servants. Most of these are not fully commercially wiser than many natural tax dodgers out in the wilderness-animal cunning has its place in that jungle, &amp; this avenue of tax avoidance/evasion can never be fully cleaned out.

The current successes have bee n very effective &amp; the ATO would be well advised to let sleeping cats lay-but keep one eye open to any real effective plans that arise that significantly impact upon tax receipts.
