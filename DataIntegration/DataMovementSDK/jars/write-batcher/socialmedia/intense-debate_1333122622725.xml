He started to Wheeze and Cough and his tongue was swelling. I took him to the E. R. of a local hospital that was not in the network of our Blue Cross Blue Shield plan. I am a family physician so I knew what was happening. The E.R. doctor was a colleague and a friend. Every thing went very well. He got oxygen, IV adrenalin, inhaled bronchodilator, two types of I.V. antihistamine, steroids and within about 40 minutes was nearly back to perfect health. It couldn't have been a better time in the E.R. 

The bill was only about $1200 for the hospital and $350 for the E.R. doctor. So what was the problem? The insurance company said that the code the hospital billed for the diagnosis of tree nut allergy is not an emergency code.  Since it is not an emergency, the entire payment was denied since the hospital was not in the network except for emergencies. (The hospital is the only one for 30 miles.) So (being familiar somewhat with diagnosis coding) I looked up the code for anaphylaxis to tree nuts and told the insurance company to use that code. They said, sorry we can't change the bill the hospital sent. I called the hospital and they finally either wrote it Off (I hope not) or rebilled after I sent them a copy of the pages in the coding manual that show that the condition was an emergency. 
I thought the insurance company should have know that the things done to save my son were emergency treatment. Had I not been a medical professional myself, I would not have known to get that obscure code for emergency reaction to tree nuts and get the code corrected. It was quite a "nightmare" which took at least twice as long as the time of treatment.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zotaf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/t33k</id></website><link>http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/open-thread/have-you-had-any-medical-bill-nightmares/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:45:56+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T03:06:18+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3sact</id><link>http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/open-thread/have-you-had-any-medical-bill-nightmares/#comment-480184973</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
