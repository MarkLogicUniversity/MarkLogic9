Her cervix started to dilate way too early and both times she was on complete bed rest at the hospital at the five month mark. She was following the diet given to her and kept all appts. The doctors actually want to include her in a study. That said baby #1 had a lot of problems.. Brain Bleeds, ventricular problems, jaundice, head growth problems, etc but he has pulled through and is on track for his adjusted age. Baby #2 only problem so far is rop which they intend to fix with laser surgery.
I'm Glad my nephews are alive and well because before this I didn't know the I s and outs of the NICU and how stressful such a joyous thing could be. I have since joined the march of dimes... Every little bit helps.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6z76fj</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/uf8t</id></website><link>http://madamenoire.com/151578/premature-birth-rates-for-african-american-women-remains-high/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T15:46:25+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T11:49:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwec46</id><link>http://madamenoire.com/151578/premature-birth-rates-for-african-american-women-remains-high/#comment-480654658</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
