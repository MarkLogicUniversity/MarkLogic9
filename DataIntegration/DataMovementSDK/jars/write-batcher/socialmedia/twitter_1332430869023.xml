1. His premeditated and deliberate gross over spending and theft of trillions of dollars from taxpayers to union allies, government employees, crony capitalists, and political donors is unparalleled in U.S. and human history, and is destroying our economy. It will leave future generations enslaved.
2. He has willfully and deliberately blocked the states from enforcing immigration law and has facilitated illegal immigration, to simultaneously boost his partyâ€™s future election prospects as well as erode the culture and language of the U.S.
3. He has taken and continues to take actions which weaken and embarrass the U.S. in areas of foreign policy, both emboldening enemies and alienating our allies.
4. His â€œjusticeâ€&#157; department created and executed Fast and Furious in an attempt to undermine the fundamental right of self defense of U.S. citizens, while directly resulting in the deaths of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent and and hundreds, if not thousands of Mexican citizens.
5. He continues to allow and encourage his environmental â€œprotectionâ€&#157; agency to force highly questionable, extremely expensive policies on U.S. business, resulting in decreased competitiveness and increased costs to those businesses, while  virtually no environment Gain whatsoever.
6. He encourages absolute abortion â€œfreedomâ€&#157; against the unborn, with policies that make even liberal Europe Blush, and that Europe rejects. His "justice" department has abandoned defending DOMA and the institution upon which all societies are built.
7. He has appointed two ULTRA liberals to the Supreme Court, and with another term will appoint more to stack the deck against the written U.S. Constitution and for the socialist agenda.
