Paramedics are called to the scene whenever anyone is hurt and Bleeding because it’s the law the cops must have them treated before they can transport. Was he treated? We do not know yet, but a lot of people on here would have already hung him and have people putting Bounties (contract toKill) on his head..  That makes you fuckingOutOfControlMorons…..
The bigger crime is how the boy’s community has reacted without waiting on the facts, having Libs try to convict when nothing has been released shows the shallow mentality. They got Al Sharpton, the Panthers and Spike lee trying to insight a race war over a very tragic story that is being properly investigated even by Obama. However where is the arrest of Spike for attempted murder of the innocent couple who has had to flee their home after receiving death threats? You wonder why we are so armed and ready…. You can bet we are….
