The oil companies pay a mountain of money in taxes, while operating on some very thin margins. They also create thousands upon thousands of very good paying jobs. The work is exausting in weather that is  Too hot or too Cold, but the pay is outstanding. These oil companies have done a hell of a better job of "spreading the wealth" than anything the government does. If they made as much Off a gallon of gas as the government, we would probably be paying $10+ a gallon. </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zb4f2</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/egg0</id></website><link>http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/03/29/santelli_why_doesnt_obama_go_after_apples_profits-comments.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T21:04:55+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:50:39+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3ji2i</id><link>http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/03/29/santelli_why_doesnt_obama_go_after_apples_profits-comments.html#comment-479989182</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/ce11q</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
