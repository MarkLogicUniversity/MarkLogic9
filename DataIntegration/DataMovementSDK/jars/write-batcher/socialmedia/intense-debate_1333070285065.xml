Iv'e had my nose broken before, and it Bleeds heavily and you need something like bandages to stop the Bleeding. Also, if someone is getting their head pounded onto pavement repeatedly one would think he would have much more Bleeding or even a concussion....it's obvious that Zimmerman's life was not in danger and the fight as extreme as Zimmerman said.....I bet Zimmerman couldn't stand his phony authority being questioned by a black kid, attempted to restrain him until police arrived because as Zimmy said "these a***holes Always get away." The kid didn't think he should have stayed, Zimmy physically tried to keep him there, the kid fights back, a little scuffle ensues, the cops are arriving any minute, he cant be seen by the police getting beat up by a kid, that wouldn't help his wanna be cop status....so he used his gun on a kid...like a wimp.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zcxr4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T06:16:22+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T17:51:40+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3x4eb</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html#comment-479693902</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/g6zxa</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
