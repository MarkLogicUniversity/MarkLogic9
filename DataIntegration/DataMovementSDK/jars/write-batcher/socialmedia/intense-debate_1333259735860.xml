I hear ya. Been high on what DM is doing since I watched his first 3 trades. He immediately reminded me of Joe Burke. And, I saw quickly that he understands how to build a competitive team in a small market. The farm system. Problem is, that is a very, very slow, arduous process. But, it's the only way to compete in a small market, where you can't just go buy any player you want.Â  

I don't predict the Royals to make the playoffs this year. I think they are still a year away. But, I do predict that they will compete for a playoff Spot.Â  And, the thing is with young teams like this, when they break out, it can be really sudden. 

So. Here is my prediction. If the Royals are within 5 games of the Tigers by the all-star break, I think they will actually win the division. I think the Royals will keep getting stronger and stronger as the season progresses, and all their young players continue to develop.Â  Problem is, I don't see them within 5 games of Detroit at the All Star break.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zoag9</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/dnmb</id></website><link>http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/29/3523348/royals-finalize-roster-with-teaford.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T02:18:54+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T01:31:30+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwbyz0</id><link>http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/29/3523348/royals-finalize-roster-with-teaford.html#comment-481408811</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/cztvw</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
