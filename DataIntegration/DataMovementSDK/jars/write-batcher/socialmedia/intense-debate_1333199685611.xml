Whenever a team drafts for need, it misses on talent. You have to draft Best Player Available regardless of how many perceived needs you have.

You can Always fill the LT Spot with a competent free agent who may not be nearly as good as Peters, but will provide an adequate level of performance in his place.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67mlol</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/xiyd</id></website><link>http://igglesblitz.com/philadelphia-eagles-2/jason-peters-hurt/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T15:47:10+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T18:15:21+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwzgr4</id><link>http://igglesblitz.com/philadelphia-eagles-2/jason-peters-hurt/#comment-481030254</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/z8dh5</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
