People who I have known for years and whom are avowedly non-political are calling the Algerians all sorts of filthy names (I won't repeat them here) and the Muslims in the area have gone to ground.Â 

There was particular fury over the burial of this creature on French soil with lots of people saying he should have been cremated and his ashes thrown away on a garbage dump.It is not just these murders that have sparked this, it is the car burnings, robberies, rapes, riots and all the other elements that go with having a Muslim infestation.I rather suspect that Marine will do well in the first round of the French Presidential Elections even though Sarkozy is "getting tough" on theÂ militants. It must be remembered this awful, terrorist crime took place on his watch.

Below I attach an article that touches on the elements I have been explaining and on the apologists explanation for these crimes.

Itâ€™s Wrong to Make Victim of Child Killerby Paul SheehanShares in The New York Times Company have slid from $US25 to $US6.89 (S6.60) during the past four years. The company has stopped making money. Its flagship newspaper has also stopped making sense when confronted with realities that do not accord with its ingrained world view.On March 20, after Europe was rocked by a string of murders in France,Â The New York TimesÂ ran a prominent story which inferred the killings were a byproduct of anti-immigrant sentiment: â€œThe political debate around the shootings, and whether the deaths were somehow inspired by anti-immigrant talk, is likely to continue â€” both as a weapon in the presidential campaign and as a more general soul-searching about the nature of France . . . In a period of economic Anxiety, high unemployment and concerns about the war in Afghanistan and radical Islam, the far right in Europe has made considerable .â€&#157;For theÂ Times, the greatest threat to social cohesion in France is the far right, not the demographic challenge presented by an increasingly disaffected, de-assimilating, rapidly growing minority of 5 million Muslims.Even after it was revealed that the killer was a Muslim who supported al-Qaeda, progressives went into overdrive to dissociate the violence from Islam. The most egregious example appeared on the ABC website, by Tariq Ramadan, a professor of Islamic studies at Oxford. He set new lows in rationalising bigotry:â€œTwenty-three-year-old Mohamed Merah was a familiar face within and beyond his neighbourhood. People describe him as quiet, easy-going, nothing at all like an â€˜extremist jihadi Salafistâ€™ ready to kill for a religious or political cause . . .â€œReligion was not Mohammed Merahâ€™s problem; nor is politics. A French citizen frustrated at being unable to find his place, to give his life dignity and meaning in his own country, he would find two political causes through which he could articulate his distress: Afghanistan and Palestine. He attacks symbols like the army, and kills Jews, Christians and Muslims without distinction. His political thought is that of a young man adrift, imbued neither with the values of Islam, or driven by racism and anti-Semitism.â€&#157;What a load of reprehensible drivel.Mohammed Merah did not kill without distinction. He was highly specific. He wanted to kill Muslim soldiers in the French army. He wanted to kill Jews. His killings were premeditated. He filmed the murders as he did them, a tactic frequently used and advocated by al-Qaeda. He had a history of crime and a collection of weapons. He told police he had travelled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to train as a jihad fighter. He had been on a watch list of Muslim extremists, one reason the police found him quite quickly. When they approached he opened fire.His film of the shootings was mailed to the al-Jazeera TV network for dissemination. The footage depicted all seven murders, taken with a camera slung from the gunmanâ€™s neck. The film had been dubbed with verses from the Koran invoking jihad and the greatness of Islam.Merahâ€™s mother is married to the father of Sabri Essid, a member of an underground network that recruited fighters for al-Qaeda in Iraq. He was convicted on terrorism charges in France in 2009. Merahâ€™s brother, Abdelkader, was also investigated but not charged. He has now been charged with complicity in the seven murders by his brother.The more we learn about this story, the more sinister it becomes.During Merahâ€™s time in prison he studied the Koran. The French prison system has become a fertile recruitment ground for radical Islam. Merah had also formed a connection with Forsane Alizza, Arabic for â€œknights of honourâ€&#157;, which had 2000 followers on Facebook before it was  in January by the French Interior Ministry for inciting racial hatred.Forsane Alizza is one of several linked groups in Europe, notably Shariah4UK and Sharia4Belgium, with others in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Scandinavia. According to the Pew Research Centre in the US, about 100 million Muslims express support for al-Qaeda and thousands are in Europe.In contrast, support for race war among the far right in Europe is minuscule. The killing rampage by a far-right gunman in Norway last year revealed no connections to a wider movement.The primary objective of Forsane Alizza, according to its website, is to â€œsupport the mujahideen everywhereâ€&#157;. The group disavows democracy. It agitates for sharia in Europe. Its principal targets are the French military, especially Muslims in the military, and Jews. These are exactly the targets Mohammed Merah selected. But Professor Ramadan portrayed him as a frustrated, adrift, distressed, non-racist, non-political, non-religious Frenchman. A murderer of children becomes a victim.Speaking of rationalisations for bigotry, tonight a debate will be held at the University of Sydney featuring a speaker from Hizb ut-Tahrir. The group is Banned in many countries for advocating jihad.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67y906</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/y81i</id></website><link>http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/national/world-8-phone-hackers-more-interesting-police-grooming-gangs</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T17:39:16+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-31T05:16:13+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwfvea</id><link>http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/national/world-8-phone-hackers-more-interesting-police-grooming-gangs#comment-481557529</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/qh2b</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
