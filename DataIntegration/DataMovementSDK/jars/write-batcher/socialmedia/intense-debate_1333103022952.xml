Really??  Prove it, lowlife....knock your most beloved family member in the head, string them up and Bleed them out the same way you do those horses!!!  We don't need them if they are any relation to you anyway.  You are the most retched P.O.S. I've ever seen wallis.  You want to help so much, do ya?  Well do us all a huge favor and drop dead.  I need you to quit wasting my air, you nasty looking waste of human flesh.  If you ever discover you've got terminal cancer or anything along those lines, let us know that too, will you?  I'm just waiting for something to finally celebrate!  I ever find out you're putting horse meat in any of my food there will be the biggest gd lawsuit you ever imagined.
