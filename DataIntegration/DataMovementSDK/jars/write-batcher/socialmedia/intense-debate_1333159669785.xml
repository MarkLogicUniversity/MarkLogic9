Now, this is the biggest hidden story since The Act of Union, 1707.Â In 1695 Scotland's economy was shattered by an unsuccessful attempt to colonize the Darien Peninsula, between North and South America.

Scotland, literally bankrupt, was forced to accept the Treaty of Union, in 1707, uniting the parliaments of England and Scotland. This carefully worded document brought advantage to both countries: in particular, it gave Scotland a badly needed boost to her economy and the right to Presbyterianism, and removed the threat of further war between the two countries.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zix5h</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9174593/Treasury-stretched-and-did-not-see-crisis-coming-before-recession-hit.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T04:51:52+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T13:05:31+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwm74g</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9174593/Treasury-stretched-and-did-not-see-crisis-coming-before-recession-hit.html#comment-480716861</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/8c65l</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
