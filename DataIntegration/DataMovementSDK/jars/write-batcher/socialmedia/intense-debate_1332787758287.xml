That new Dawn was England with Geoff Cooke. Now many people wont remember that regime. But it was a regime built around honesty, with the likes of Moore, Probyn, Dooley, Haliday, Carling, Guscott, Richards, Underwood. The first appearance in a WC Final was the highlight. But those players really did play for the shirt. Lancaster has brought an ethic, an honesty here again. Lets hope he gets Wayne Smith on board &amp; the RFU give Stuart Lancaster the time &amp; backing his plans deserve.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/660lyk</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/gcrd</id></website><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/9164650/England-job-should-go-to-interim-coach-Stuart-Lancaster-and-not-a-dream-team-including-Nick-Mallet.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-24T20:54:52+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-26T17:43:42+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mk9bf7</id><link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/9164650/England-job-should-go-to-interim-coach-Stuart-Lancaster-and-not-a-dream-team-including-Nick-Mallet.html#comment-476573811</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/6lva8</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev/><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-24</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
