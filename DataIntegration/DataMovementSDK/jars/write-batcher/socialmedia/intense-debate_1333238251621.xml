Â I'm getting sick of having to down Austin because smarks want to think he's the undisputed best at everything. Austin was great and everyone loved/loves him, but for 2 years the guy played second fiddle to The Rock; not just on screen with booking, but in merchandise sales and obviously publicity. 
Â  Besides the love from the crowd which to this day he still and will Always have, nothing was ever the same for him after his injury. He actually goes on to say something similar to this post in his DVD released a few months ago.

 I think the number one issue is that because everyone loves him, no one ever thought of him as second place ever dispute the booking or his merchandise sales.</body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/67l3k4</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/e1x9</id></website><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0330/551242/john-cena/</link><postedTime>2012-03-30T20:12:51+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-30T22:43:05+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/mwqn7h</id><link>http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0330/551242/john-cena/#comment-481283113</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/as16o</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-30</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
