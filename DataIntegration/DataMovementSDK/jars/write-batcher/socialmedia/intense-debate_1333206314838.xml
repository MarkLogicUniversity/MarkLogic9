This was my first AR Conference, so I had no idea who anyone was with the exception of the speakers. Jared made some mention of a possible plant, so I guess this doesn't surprise me.  I don't recall meeting or chatting with this guy.

I did notice that a few people were reticent and a bit careful when chatting with me. I sat in a different Spot for each speaker because I wanted to meet as many people as possible. It Dawned on me that some people probably thought I was a plant. Can't say I blame them for being careful. Well, I assure you I'm not a plant.
