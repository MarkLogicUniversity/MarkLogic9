Anyone wearing a cotton poly blend shirt? Woven of two kinds of materials?Â  Sinners, I rebuke you franky in my pure cotton shirt! The point of Jesus was that you can't live this, youÂ do sin, and you will sin again. We're to do our best, but God knows we stink at not sinning. We are to forgive each other. I hope you intolerant types ever cursed your mother or father or per Leviticus 20:9 you must now be put to death (hardly anyone would make it out of the teen years). Oh and don't get me started on all you heterosexuals and your adultery (Lev 20:10), well there's going to be a whole lot of stones needed for those executions.Accept the love of Christ and forgive the sins of others, even as your sins have been forgiven. 
Leviticus 193 â€œâ€˜Each of you must respect your mother and father, and you must observe my Sabbaths. I am the LORD your God. 
 4 â€œâ€˜Do not turn to idols or make metal gods for yourselves. I am the LORD your God. 
 5 â€œâ€˜When you sacrifice a fellowship offering to the LORD, sacrifice it in such a way that it will be accepted on your behalf. 6 It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it or on the next day; anything left over until the third day must be Burned up. 7 If any of it is eaten on the third day, it is impure and will not be accepted. 8 Whoever eats it will be held responsible because they have desecrated what is holy to the LORD; they must be cut  from their people. 
 9 â€œâ€˜When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. 10 Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner. I am the LORD your God. 
 11 â€œâ€˜Do not steal. 
   â€œâ€˜Do not lie. 
   â€œâ€˜Do not deceive one another. 
 12 â€œâ€˜Do not swear falsely by my name and so profane the name of your God. I am the LORD. 
 13 â€œâ€˜Do not defraud or rob your neighbor. 
   â€œâ€˜Do not hold back the wages of a hired worker overnight. 
 14 â€œâ€˜Do not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block in front of the blind, but fear your God. I am the LORD. 
 15 â€œâ€˜Do not pervert justice; do not show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the great, but judge your neighbor fairly. 
 16 â€œâ€˜Do not go about spreading slander among your people. 
   â€œâ€˜Do not do anything that endangers your neighborâ€™s life. I am the LORD. 
 17 â€œâ€˜Do not hate a fellow Israelite in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor frankly so you will not share in their guilt. 
 18 â€œâ€˜Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD. 
 19 â€œâ€˜Keep my decrees. 
   â€œâ€˜Do not mate different kinds of animals. 
   â€œâ€˜Do not plant your field with two kinds of seed. 
   â€œâ€˜Do not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material.Â  

Leviticus 20
Punishments for Sin
 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 â€œSay to the Israelites: â€˜Any Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molek is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him. 3 I myself will set my face against him and will cut him  from his people; for by sacrificing his children to Molek, he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. 4 If the members of the community close their eyes when that man sacrifices one of his children to Molek and if they fail to put him to death, 5 I myself will set my face against him and his family and will cut them  from their people together with all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Molek. 
 6 â€œâ€˜I will set my face against anyone who turns to mediums and spiritists to prostitute themselves by following them, and I will cut them  from their people. 
 7 â€œâ€˜Consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am the LORD your God. 8 Keep my decrees and follow them. I am the LORD, who makes you holy. 
 9 â€œâ€˜Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death. Because they have cursed their father or mother, their blood will be on their own head. 
 10 â€œâ€˜If a man commits adultery with another manâ€™s wifeâ€”with the wife of his neighborâ€”both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death. 
 11 â€œâ€˜If a man has sexual relations with his fatherâ€™s wife, he has dishonored his father. Both the man and the woman are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. 
 12 â€œâ€˜If a man has sexual relations with his daughter-in-law, both of them are to be put to death. What they have done is a perversion; their blood will be on their own heads. 
 13 â€œâ€˜If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. 
 14 â€œâ€˜If a man marries both a woman and her mother, it is wicked. Both he and they must be Burned in the fire, so that no wickedness will be among you. 
 15 â€œâ€˜If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he is to be put to death, and you must kill the animal. 
 16 â€œâ€˜If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, kill both the woman and the animal. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. 
 17 â€œâ€˜If a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his father or his mother, and they have sexual relations, it is a disgrace. They are to be publicly removed from their people. He has dishonored his sister and will be held responsible. 
 18 â€œâ€˜If a man has sexual relations with a woman during her monthly period, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has also uncovered it. Both of them are to be cut  from their people. 
 19 â€œâ€˜Do not have sexual relations with the sister of either your mother or your father, for that would dishonor a close relative; both of you would be held responsible. 
 20 â€œâ€˜If a man has sexual relations with his aunt, he has dishonored his uncle. They will be held responsible; they will die childless. 
 21 â€œâ€˜If a man marries his brotherâ€™s wife, it is an Act of impurity; he has dishonored his brother. They will be childless. 
 22 â€œâ€˜Keep all my decrees and laws and follow them, so that the land where I am bringing you to live may not Vomit you out. 23 You must not live according to the customs of the nations I am going to drive out before you. Because they did all these things, I abhorred them. 24 But I said to you, â€œYou will possess their land; I will give it to you as an inheritance, a land flowing with milk and honey.â€&#157; I am the LORD your God, who has set you apart from the nations. 
 25 â€œâ€˜You must therefore make a distinction between clean and unclean animals and between unclean and clean birds. Do not defile yourselves by any animal or bird or anything that moves along the groundâ€”those that I have set apart as unclean for you. 26 You are to be holy to me because I, the LORD, am holy, and I have set you apart from the nations to be my own. 
 27 â€œâ€˜A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.â€™â€&#157; </body><verb>update</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6zrvne</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/ogrn</id></website><link>http://godfatherpolitics.com/4439/gay-bullies-target-apparel-company-because-it-wont-print-shirts-for-gay-pride-festival/</link><postedTime>2012-03-29T12:51:27+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T22:47:28+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3jjil</id><link>http://godfatherpolitics.com/4439/gay-bullies-target-apparel-company-because-it-wont-print-shirts-for-gay-pride-festival/#comment-479986356</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/-1</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>approved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-29</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
