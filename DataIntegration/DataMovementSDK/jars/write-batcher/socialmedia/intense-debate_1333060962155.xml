Gave me the climbing Itch, so did Mt Kenya in 2011. Then Elbrus was on my radar. The ultimate goal being Everest. But I was told Delnali would be a much better prep for Everest than Elbrus, so that's where my focus is. I was born in 1968 and have has hip and elbow surgeries, and due for another hip surgery, so I'm also trying to get my money's worth! Lol.
