It would be madness however to use all the shale  on electricity generation. It has so many other more valuable uses, transport fuel, feedstock for chemicals and fertilizer, home Heating.

We need to get on with nuclear and gas by whatever means it takes (Relying on the Germans and Frau Frump in particular was Always a disaster waiting to happen). They are dismantling most of the rest of Europe by other means (and not a Panzer in site).
 
Get with the programme Dave;  junk the latest “LibDum” deadhead (the tooth fairy really does not exist) and put John Redwood in charge of this national drive to energy self sufficiency (and incidentally, lower carbon, if you believe in that sort of thing!)
 40% CCGT (shale + coal bed methane), 40% Nuclear, 20 other (some tidal/ wave)
