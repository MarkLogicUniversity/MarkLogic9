Up until this morning, feeling pretty crappy...dealing with childish and unreasonable parents of my oldest daughter's friends. The level of selfishness that slithers about, is almost unnoticeable, until "Garden Anxieties" flare. It can be very frustrating and relationally counterproductive. In stark contrast, this morning, I experienced crazy, mind-blowing grace extended by my Spring Arbor University family and faculty (Had to miss classes and rehearsals because my kids don't have school). Â Is it possible to live within Reach of two completely different realms, only 40 miles apart?!? The answer is 'yes,' and I consider myself blessed. To have the opportunity to step into a heaven-esque environment after less than an hour's drive (from Tecumseh, where I live) is amazing! I'm so thankful to have a refreshing retreat after time on the battlefield!Â 

Peace,
