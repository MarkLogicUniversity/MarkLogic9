It's rare that programs will even crash crash themselves (and when they do Windows 7 , Always recovers what I was working on), and I've never had one system failure where I had to restart the computer. Neither has anyone else I know -- the consensus in my world is that Windows 7 is the tits, and while a lot of us have issues with Windows 8 at it currently exists (Start Menus needs to return and toolbar buttons), it's fast, stable and has a lot of potential. The worst program on my PC in terms of performance? Apple iTunes, without a doubt. If my wife didn't have an iPhone I would delete this program immediately. Meanwhile, my Apple at work (latest OS) is a mess with stalls, crashes, lost files, Memory problems â€” I keep the Activity Monitor running at all times so I can bail on programs that stop working all of a sudden.</body><verb>post</verb><target><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:thread/6hznhf</id><website><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:forum/5gat</id></website><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/28/tech/mobile/commentary-windows-8/index.html</link><postedTime>2012-03-28T14:12:57+00:00</postedTime><objectType>article</objectType></target><postedTime>2012-03-29T23:01:56+00:00</postedTime><object><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:comment/m3oarf</id><link>http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/28/tech/mobile/commentary-windows-8/index.html#comment-479998645</link><objectType>comment</objectType></object><actor><id>tag:gnip.disqus.com:2012:account/zdncp</id><objectType>person</objectType></actor><disqusTypePrev>unapproved</disqusTypePrev><disqusType>approved</disqusType><platform>disqus</platform><posted_date>2012-03-28</posted_date><followers>0</followers><statuses>0</statuses><region>N.A.</region></marklogic>
